Q1sbwvVQXV2734tPgoKj4Q,Total bill for this horrible service? Over $8Gs. These crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $69 for 3 pills. I checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents EACH! Avoid Hospital ERs at all costs.,1.0
8e9HxxLjjqc9ez5ezzN7iQ,"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality

Many of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.

The service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.

It's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options.",1.0
yi0R0Ugj_xUx_Nek0-_Qig,"Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf. I know I'm going on about the salad ... But it was perfect.

Drink prices were pretty good.

The Server, Dawn, was friendly and accommodating. Very happy with her.

In summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!",5.0

qrffudO73zsslZbe8B9D3Q,"I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The ""Man O'War"" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. 
The only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  
Nonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are! 
The reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! 
The servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! 
After another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. 
This is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving. 
The toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.",2.0
kbtscdyz6lvrtGjD1quQTg,"Like walking back in time, every Saturday morning my sister and I was in a bowling league and after we were done, we'd spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up.

My sister was daring and play the machines hard, she was afraid of that ""tilt"" showing up and freezing the game.  I, on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure I got my quarter's worth.

This place has rows and rows of machines, some are really old and some are more of a mid 80's theme.  There is even a Ms pac man!  It was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years.",4.0

Z7wgXp98wYB57QdRY3HQ3w,"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. 
I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. 
Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews.

JVcjMhlavKKn3UIt9p9OXA,"I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out.",1.0

GJXCdrto3ASJOqKeVWPi6Q,"I *adore* Travis at the Hard Rock's new Kelly Cardenas Salon!  I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  

Travis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! 

Next Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! 

Travis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!",5.0
11a8sVPMUFtaC7_ABRkmtw,"Today was my second out of three sessions I had paid for. Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, ""well burns come with teeth whitening."" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn't stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won't be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior, who claims to be in the business for ""10 years."" Admit your wrongs, but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly.",1.0

fdiNeiN_hoCxCMy2wTRW9g,"I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, "" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?"" She does. 

My hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard ""mmmm this is so good"" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.

So-

Do order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. 

If they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. 

Do make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it's available.",4.0

G7XHMxG0bx9oBJNECG4IFg,"Tracy dessert had a big name in Hong Kong and the one in First Markham place has been here for many years now! 

Came in for some Chinese dessert, and I must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years. I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!

A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side. 

I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it! 

I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished.",3.0

Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year. Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies. The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women. 
The biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.  It's definitely a comfort food. The best part is that they ship internationally. Yes, they are that good.",5.0
6BnQwlxRn7ZuWdzninM9sQ,"I love chinese food and I love mexican food. What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a ""rice bowl"" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.

I'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a ""C"" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. 

Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. 

The jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. 

They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. 

Not gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.",3.0

Second time we came on a wednesday. We didn't know it was BBQ night, where they have a completely different menu, and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu. This menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich. The vegetarian in my party said it was awful. Also, on BBQ night you choose 2 sides. Except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad. I can't say I was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main.

W1wbNaUnbMy4b9QqY3_SAg,"Unfortunately, I must recommend not to conduct any business with Fast Fix Jewelry and Watch Repairs.  The staff is completely unprofessional and I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  I was actually shocked and walked away thinking ""wow, how do those people even have a job?""

I have never written a negative review before, I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.

I drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band.  I was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like I was bothering them.  The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave, the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said, ""I already told you?!?""  ""Is this even authentic?""  Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else.

DAC4zWY2ZMa1vxpN9RrDvA,"This review is in regards to our experience watching SuperBowl 51 February 5, 2017 at the WestGate in the theater/auditorium.

Watch the game somewhere else.....

To those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.

So at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....

We were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.
That's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.

So we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.

In summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will.",1.0

bjD0Dqn3k-fi00BXatrytg,"I tried this place because my girls are away for a month, and I REALLY wanted to try to wait until they came back, because NOBODY can hold a candle to them, but my toes were desperate.  When I went in, they were almost twice what I usually pay to begin with.  Then, before starting the pedicure, I specifically told them I already had gel polish on my toes.  They didn't tell me right then and there ""that will be an extra $5'.  No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn't even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1/2 grown.  Again, they didn't tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.  

The added stone 'massage' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that!

8swMTt9IXycp15r3WlCEmg,"One day after I satisfy my frozen yogurt craving at Kiwispoon... I get invited out to eat frozen yogurt at Piccadilly.  A rare opportunity to truly compare the two yogurt places.

Here, I tried three flavors - chocolate, pumpkin, and caramel sea salt.  Added toppings of brownie bits, chocolate caramel turtles, and mochi.

Overall, I liked the yogurt better at Kiwispoon. The frozen yogurt seems less rich in Piccadilly's and the flavors are not as strong.  The price per ounce is also marginally higher at Piccadilly's.

There are definitely pluses to Piccadilly's yogurt though.  I liked the toppings better - I thought the mochi tasted better, the brownie pieces were bigger, and the chocolate caramel turtles went great on ice cream.  The chocolate caramel turtles should be a standard topping for both frozen yogurt and ice cream places.

u1jQX0KfnG3AHty4ifEpFA,"notes: 1 visit, breakfast/lunch
overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.",4.0

After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes.

vBRxlgkpDTXjWiYBp1V6GA,They keep there appointments on time and are pretty efficient. However I am very disappointed in how they think that just because I am a girl that I do not know what is going on with my car's tires. The guy that helped me out told me that my two front tires tread was extremely low and that I would be needing two new tires in a month or two. He told me that he could show me the same tires I have on there now and how much they would be. When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price. So when I bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that. I honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280.,1.0

SERVICE: Extremely Poor

While I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. 

MAIN: Caprese Salad

The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).

MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it)

Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked.

Very large space, open layout.  Been here a few times years ago. I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib. 

They provide a self serve drink area, which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation. 

Unlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games.

Saae_VVf_v0fyNmB6Dc4kw,"I've never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be ""picky"" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.",1.0

I always like to chose a signature burger so I opted for the Spicy Cajun Burger and combo'd it up with there Beer Battered Rings and a Jones Strawberry-Lime  Soda.

Its a small location with an even smaller patio ( maybe 8 bar stools on a cramped balcony) that looks onto Charles Street. But definitely sit outside if you can grab a seat. Luckily the patio was vacant that late afternoon.

Toppings - They Spicy Cajun Burger - Avocado, jalapeños, lettuce,
Jalapeño havarti, tomatoes, Cajun spice & Smokey chipotle & honey mayo. There was ample toppings on the burger, I enjoyed the avocado on my burger, overall not too spicy but good kick from the sliced jalapeños.

Meat - Grilled perfectly, tasted average, but I found it too small compared to the bun.

Bun - Very soft, tasted good, but didn't hold up against the burger and all the toppings and at the end I was left with lots of bun and no more burger.

Beer Battered Onion Rings - Very thick batter on these rings, golden brown, crunchy, very filling.

Drink -Jones Strawberry-Lime Soda - Yummy not sour but good balance,

UoFxqWXBluvS4Q32spb8Lg,"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. 

I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.

Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.

The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) 

I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. 

The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead.

UIvFkXLBxWxM6aekvaCp8Q,"Took my kids here to hang out on one fine 72 degree sunny Saturday in February. Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.

Too bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. 

The playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! 

After a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the ""nice stuff"" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, ""Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?"" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.

After carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff.

I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!",5.0
VukV341GHtm9kcvoKR-5vQ,"Came here for the ""midnight"" launch of the PSVR. After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren't pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. 

The previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.

Not only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location).

My favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.

Mario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks. 

Plus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons.

We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!",4.0

l7KB334CXThAcmZPOvF1zw,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2.0

Between Chip and Sylvia, I was ""sold"" on that apartment and we got the ""paperwork"" going. I enjoyed my stay there which lasted 6 months (3 months more that I initially signed up for).
When it came time to give my notice, Sylvia gave me all the details I needed, and these were pretty much the same that were in our initial Lease Agreement. They were kind enough to give me ample notice to show the apartment during my last 30 days, without too much inconvenience. Sylvia helped me tie up a few loose ends and even arranged to pick up a lamp for me that needed to be repaired when I moved out.
 
I would certainly reach out to the team at Sold on Charlotte again.

miAbIuIln8YfLoo6rf3MyQ,"Visited this restaurant after a 3 hour drive to get to it.  We, my boyfriend and I,  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.  

So we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how ""hot"" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable ""romantic"" evening of my life...

Now to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a ""salad"", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.


The soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.

The appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!

The salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.

The meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.

The dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?

The wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...

The atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.

We finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! 

Upon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.

Would I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.

SZrbK4K4YaiDMfkUuYGiNQ,"I've tried to shop at Montblanc Toronto several times but the selection is very limited and the sales staff while attentive, not very friendly. Recently I tried to replace a ring I received as a gift and lost.  The Toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me, I asked them if they could check other locations with no avail.  

Because the ring had a lot of sentimental value I decided to call the  Hong Kong location where the ring was purchased. Over the phone the clerk, Jane, and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide.  She called me the next day from Hong Kong to inform me she found the last ring in London and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until I return to Hong Kong in a few months.  Not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost, I paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier.  The ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again :)...  This is the type of service that builds loyalty.  

The Montblanc store in Hong Kong is located in Pacific Mall. Jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on Kowloon Side on Canton Road. I'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me.  I will be forever be loyal to the Hong Kong location. Thanks Jane!  I'm giving 2 stars to the Toronto location, the Hong Kong location would easily have 5 stars.",2.0
oMKVNZp6C8866Lz_8HMoyg,"I LOVE this place! I have found the staff to be extremely knowledgable, beyond helpful and always willing to go above and beyond to do whatever they can to assist you. This store carries products that I can't find anywhere else besides online. They are great about returns if you have a finicky eater (like mine). 
I also love that they have no agenda when it comes to helping you select a certain food. They listen to what you're looking for and then make suggestions based on the info you've given them. They're also well versed in the latest pet food recalls (which are hard to stay on top of these days!)
If you sign up online, they offer discounts and specials all the time which helps with some of the pricier food. Organized, clean, and a huge selection. I have absolutely no complaints about this place... Except maybe that when they hold weekend pet adoptions I get depressed that I can't take all the animals home.",5.0

She was unapologetic and offered me a next day appointment, like she was doing me a favor since I ""MISSED"" my appointment.

Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home.

niN5qW_M5Y0W0zQEcQcFig,"My family and I came in on Wed. Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said ""No"" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.
The worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in.

nx3RLktQxXT6ACp5M3OJwA,"Fresh food, tasty, and amazing service are the 3 characteristics that come to my mind when thinking about this place. However price is a big downside.
Went there on a Tuesday night, did not have to wait for a table and service was quick and the staff was very friendly. The menu options are pretty limited but definitely focused on providing the most typical Portuguese experience. 
One major downside: the food portions are extremely small for the price you pay. The value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style. In a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there. 
2 mini starters, 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full. The desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream, probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for. Otherwise it was too pricy.

Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered.",3.0

They called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment. I advised the lady that no one was living in my father's apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way I could rush down to the place and open the door for them. I mean I live in the same complex so it wouldn't be a long wait! She said she would let the guys know but no promise...okaaaaay? I paid $1,200 for furniture, I am a repeat customer, and you can't make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LANDLORD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off, when I got my dad's key to check the place out before he arrived, there was a note on the COUNTER that said ""Sorry we Missed you""....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn't put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOORS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren't for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily.

BRNHu0kBhbiTMXhbERNw6A,"A toned down version of the king street location, GotStyle is a great store primarily for the service you receive.

It's definitely not for everyone - there is a price tag attached. But if you shop at places like Holt Renfrew or even the Bay then this place is considerably better in my opinion.  The reason - the sales agents are just better. They have pretty good sales twice a year, which is when I tend to go but sizing is obviously an issue at those times. I appreciate that they carry various price points in the mid to high range.  

Overall, I wouldn't get my formal wear from here. That's just me personally. I'd rather go to the U.S. and pay half the price for the same quality. But if you can't do that, they have an excellent selection and great tailors. You can find cheaper tailors in Toronto, but at least at GotStyle you don't have to go through the hassle of finding the right tailer. You can trust the store. 

They have an excellent selection of casual clothing and interesting and cool clothing pieces too.

We had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.

Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.

The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.

For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.

Earlier today my friend and I dropped in to grab some lunch.. the staff either all lost their dogs this morning, or just have the absolute worst attitudes you've ever seen in human beings. Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling ""ughhhhh god help me!"" Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for ""here or to go"" the original server says aloudly ""to-go hopefully!!!"" Wtf... I'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don't expect livelihood for very much longer, that's how.

Savers is the heaven and hell of Las Vegas thrift stores. You have to be willing to get dirty, to get on your knees and repent. You have to suffer through repeated disapointments in order to achieve the nirvana of a true thrift store find. 
First trip out - chewed up Barbie dolls and incomplete board games. Second trip - A set of Christmas lights marked for $2 more than at the Walmart they same from. But then, on the third trip back, there it is - the chimera. The unicorn. The 36"" 1970's black velvet painting of two tigers in flagrante delicto. The Elvis cookie jar. The wine cooler made out of an abandoned suit of armor. The red leather Michael Jackson Thriller jacket. A bronze toreador sculpture. And it's only $12.99.

ewmaCrLXQW7mg1Z4gAtgZg,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.

The enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were sautéed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.

Warning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas. 

By the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.

This place gets five stars and I can't wait to go back. Please, please try this place. It was empty when I walked in and that's a shame. They should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service. It's also very affordable.

xLPt2YOqBTJ1fNwC3bPdOw,"I've dined here a few times with my family and we keep coming back, despite a few misses.  I really want to be a fan of this place though. The red salsa is good and hot while the green satisfies the less adventurous.  The guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there.  I normally get the tacos, either brisket or fish and they're really great, though I'm not a fan of mango salsas in general.  
Last night we had the guac and a couple of Wednesday special margaritas which were just right.  We thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl, coupled with distracted waitstaff, became empty quickly.
My wife and I split the main dish, which was a special ""baked brisket enchilada"" recommended by the waitress.  It was huge and definitely more than enough for too, but we didn't care for it. There didn't seem to be much beef in it; it was mostly sauce and cheese. 
It will be awhile before we go again, and I think we'll stick to the tacos when we do. In summary, lots to like here, but I'd say stick to the basics.",3.0

The soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half.
Very disappointed in how much came on the sub. They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want.
I can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers!

I also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled.

We had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup.

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!! They don't false advertise there either! Furious!  Their food and prices have gone downhill fast! They lost mine and my family's business for good!!",1.0

iSmfAVy6cApgXIYHsldsmA,"My husband and I used to order from here more than I'd like to admit (almost weekly). The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. 

Last time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.

I paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any ""inconvenience"" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. 

When we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. 

I walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or ""I'll be right with you."" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say ""Wow, you are really something else."" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. 

I honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.

I realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.",1.0

fPRmEOJy0DoT8P8YQDF5lQ,"I'm a fan of BMW.  My X3 lasted me 10 years and although there were a few hiccups, I can still say that car was pretty darn reliable and I got my money's worth. But sometimes, you just have to let go and find a replacement.

I did my research and considered getting a Mini, Fiat or a Lexus. My loyalty is with BMW. I locked in on a particular car and off to the dealer I went. We were walking around the lot looking at other models and colors when a car salesman saw us and helped me get my car. My sister kept throwing her ideas and opinions as to what car I should get. I told David (sales advisor) what features I need and we ended up with the first car I was looking at.

Then, the dreaded test driving the car. I'm not a big fan of driving a car that isn't mine...or driving, period! I think convincing me to test drive took the most time and David told me to just drive around the lot but that was a trick! There was a part of the lot that's blocked off by a semi and the only way around it is to get on the road. My sister was a backseat driver as if I needed to be more anxious but David kept me calm. He's so funny. We made it back to the dealership in one piece.

I signed my papers and wrote my check but it was gym time so, we told David we'd come back for the car after the gym since they still had to detail it anyway. It was the most entertaining car-buying experience ever. We were all laughing and chatting about cars, the gym, nutrition, Hello Kitty, Yoda, etc. David explained and showed me what my car can do and at the end he said, ""I wish all my clients are as fun as you.""

3Qc49B7dA0ONmCxrn5iwCQ,"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...

There are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an ""Old Western Vegas"" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. 

FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? 

I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  

I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. 

A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks.

second A place that proudly serves ""Middle eastern"" and also ""Greek"" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion. 

And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good!

UuwV_kvSBEiRD0lbbUWNbg,"A tale of two locations (AKA: AVOID 7700 S Autoplex, GO TO 616 W Baseline)

First the good: 616 W Baseline

I have been a loyal repeat customer of Cobblestone Auto Spa ever since I encountered Jared, one of the managers at the 616 W Baseline. 

The first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.

I am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.

COBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!

Now the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex

I first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.

I then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.

I then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.

When I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.

Finally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.

I went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.

The next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. 

I knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.

I suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.

As a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.

I went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. 

They reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.

Jared to the rescue:

I took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.

The desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.

The table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water. 

Do I sound like I'm obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.

The sushi was good, but not great.
The main courses were simple but extremely expensive.
All sides were extra.
We spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each.

We got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken, add cheese...so good, lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite.
My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here.

It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great.

Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey.

The restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us.  We waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came.   We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.

The young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages. Replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves.

The young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray. Not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back.

Pizza was fine, but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it. Fair for the price.

w9vhFm9z4xZ5MFer1inIeg,The worst. Got there 45 minutes after the store was supposed to be open and they weren't ready.  Ordered a sandwich and the oven hadn't been turned on.  I asked how long and the employee said a few minutes. 8 minutes later oven still not preheated and I let her know I had to go.  She then pulls the sandwich out of the oven.  Cleary the sandwich would not have been prepared correctly.  I did not take sandwich and had to leave to get to an appointment. My  quick stop for a coffee and breakfast to go was over 15 minutes.  When I sent in a complaint to the head office the slow response was they couldn't give me a credit but would send over coupons for a couple of beverages.  That is ridiculous.  I wanted a refund on the sandwich I never took. I pass by this second cup 5 days a week. I'm going to keep on driving and stick with Starbucks. You should also steer clear.

hNO1_hkdUZDkqc-BjDHjrg,"These guys really are great, easy to work with, and provide a valuable service.

I worked with Sammy to coordinate a night out with 10 girls for a bachelorette party in Vegas.  We decided to go to Tryst.  Sammy was very patient in taking multiple phone calls and answering all my questions, even throwing in a couple of extra perks at my request.  The pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person, creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time.  We didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night.  It was SO easy.

Someone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out.  Sammy, knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us, called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different, better table open up, and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge.  

Craig was our host for the evening.  He contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when.  Craig was waiting to greet us and, as promised, walked us right into the club and to our table, which had our bottles, mixers and waitresses waiting.  Craig stopped back a couple of times before leaving to make sure we were settled and having a good time.

I contacted Sammy a couple more times throughout the weekend for various things, and he was more than helpful even though we weren't using them for additional reservations or nights out.

NSHW9BZ-FsScJyFSSRxHYQ,"2-3 years ago I found LifeScape Medical Associates randomly and started going there since then. Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.

There're a few reasons I don't like it there:
1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine/samples/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.

2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.

3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. 

I normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody.",1.0
a_g4eysuYC1pI9tv3MCZxA,"I love the West Side Market but I can't stand the crowds, the parking, and the general gentrified douchery that seems to accompany the entire process. For me, it's just not worth it. Enter the Food Peddler Farmer's Market. I don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood, but I'd like to shake their hand. It's just what the doctor ordered.

Imagine, if you will, a bright, airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region, rows of farm fresh eggs, coolers filled with Amish chicken and local ground beef...yeah, right. No, really, it's true. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but for an area of Cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air. It does what Cleveland and the rest of the nation needs, it encourages consumption of fresh, local foods. So what do they have to offer?

-Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables with everything from plump bing cherries to more exotic fare like chayote and California avocados. 

-A bakery with Cleveland favorites like kugel and kolaczki and a deli stocked to overflowing with meats and cheeses from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania.

-A bulk section with plenty of flour, rice, pie fillings, nuts, seeds, and other goodies.

-Giant bags of peanuts, onions, apples, and carrots.

-A wall of bulk candy packaged in little containers perfect for hiding in your cupboard behind the quinoa and flax seeds.

-Reasonable prices. It's not as cheap as fast food, no. But if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health.

I could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but I want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit. I know, it's not the West Side Market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway.

The food is the thing in any restaurant and pretty much everything was just ok. Our salesman/server;) confidently stated the steak tacos were the best menu item, and they were, but still only rated a just above average 3.5.

I had a ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables that was not coked to medium as requested (who knows why they ask in spots like this because it is pretty much never done right?). The accompanying sauce was actually very good and that saved this dish for me.

I first went in to see a couple of puppies, and I really like 2 in particular.  Because I already have a dog at home, and my boyfriend wasn't able to join me, I put one of them on hold (they will hold your pet for the day) and went back a few hours later.  It is required that if you already have a dog, you must do an introduction to make sure it is a good match.  My dog loved Sayuri, but was not as fond of the other dog.  I like to say that my dog chose our new puppy :).  

When adopting a puppy, you also recieve a free exam through the VCA Animal Hospitals.  I think that's wonderful since adopting a rescue dog can be intimidating.

Wanted the car to be reliable and not have any issues so I went ahead with all the required maintenance and then some.

1 month after all this major service the radiator blew open coming back from flagstaff.....Ok so I understand things break etc.  I take it to Arrowhead Honda Service and the explanation was since I replaced the water pump with a new one it must have increased pressure in the system. Since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator.  I was then told it was common??? OK I get the explanation, but if that was the case a month a go and common knowledge why not recommend replacing the radiator with the major service so the car would not leave me stranded???

They also had recommended the power steering pump be replaced, system flushed etc.  Hate when its not done right the first time?  Had to bring it back and wait for them to get air out of the system so the new power steering pump would stop making noise.

24 hours access with your keycard
no-contract membership options
lockers (bring your own lock)

mbVzxuQTLRPbK-RwoGJsbA,"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.

We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  

My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  

In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.

JO1EOjDfMdvC2Vrw5P-Baw,"The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. 

Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. 

The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. 

One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. 

Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.",3.0

Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.

-2j4m2ffQgPx93fszFN-yg,"This is the worst gym I've ever been to, and I've grown up in the gym business. These guys only care about your money and nothing more. When I joined I later had to cancel with them because I had to meet with my National Guard unit and I didn't know what kind of schedule I'd have. They seemed understanding and said it wasn't a problem. At this time I would have rated this gym very good, because I had fun with no issues. I even told them I'd probably start back up here after I know what schedule looked like. So I stop going after my month expired because I cancelled(even on my attendance sheet it said it was my last and only month.) I later check my bank statement and they charged me again, okay no big deal probably a mistake. I call them, no answer. Okay that's fine I'll email them explaining the mistake. I'll give them a few days to get back to me max. Hear nothing from them. Call them again, no answer. Call them again they finally answered. I explain the situation with guy that answers and he says ""Oh yeah i got your email but I forgot to call you."". At this point I'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service. Then after that he tells me no I haven't cancelled and I'm going to have to pay another two months worth. He tells me I must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken English so he must have misunderstood me when I cancelled with him a month prior to this). He won't help me out at all, just says I have to pay more. Thank god I have Navy Federal for a bank because I call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me. They repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym, they also put a stop payment on the gym. Well sure and behold I get charged by them AGAIN and I call my bank asking why did this happen? Turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment. I ask what I can do. They say to email them so I have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie.

I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait.
I was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the ""sex sells"" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally. 
To be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.

ionasM2PY_2TFbK5Dkgg6Q,"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. 

Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere.

And she made up an excuse saying how ""Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy"" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted.

We arrived at Hertz at around 2:15 PM on Aug. 24th and was able to get our rental in about 20-25 minutes.  The pick up process is pretty simple.  You can either go to a customer service rep or use their self-serve kiosk, which is what I ended up doing.

The lady who was assisting me on the kiosk phone was pretty friendly, but she was doing a lot of up-sell so it was kind of bothersome.  I didn't need a bigger car than an economy size since there was only 2 of us.  I understand that they probably work off of commission, but sometimes it's unnecessary to try and convince you to get something that you don't need.

The return process was pretty quick and easy as well.  I ended up getting charged for an extra day because I brought the car back 1.5 hours after the pick up time since my flight didn't leave until 8 PM.  Too bad they don't have a ""grace"" period for regular customers.

Other than that the car was fine.  I didn't get anything fancy, just a KIA so nothing much to write about--other than the fact that it was clean and didn't smell bad like some other rentals that I've encountered elsewhere.",3.0
HJOHmSJONel2m6Qg9eyR7g,"Had the occasion over the last few weeks to experience their sports medicine/physical therapy department.  Outstanding.  Drs. Anthony ""Tony"" Walker and Jennifer Hannon are a great team.  They really know their stuff.

Beyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients.  On each appointment we began discussing how the exercises were working, how I was feeling, what is working or not.  Then we would get into planning for that day and going forward.

I was involved in the therapy.  And we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments.

They administer a tablet form of survey asking about your condition and how it is affecting your life.  After the therapy has run its course you complete the same survey, so they have a before and after record of your condition.

Impressive and given the people cycling through this practice it was clear that the facility and all the therapists were doing something special.

3qwgrPW0hOaWi8R4FYQMBw,"This show was fun, but i was expecting more from all the hype it gets. We picked this over Chippendales cuz the idea of Australian men with their accents is so much hotter than American dancers =P. When I called in to purchase tickets an hour before the show, they said that they didn't have a table to fit 5 girls, and that we would have to separate into two tables, which was fine. But when we got there, there was 2 completely empty tables in the front of the stage! The sales people were really unorganized to not notice that was available! So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table, which gave a much better view.

The show was def entertaining, with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome, something about a man in a g-string is just wrong, you know? but nonetheless, it was very entertaining. The emcee's accent was hot, and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate, and some of the older women too, which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well, so no matter where your seats were, I think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys.

Downside though, at the end of the show, you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys, only to receive one picture. no offense, but that is a total rip off. i've been to Fantasy, which is a female stripshow,  and you can take pics with them for free, and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show, and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf? These men seemed way too jaded and full of themselves. They may be good to look at, but off-stage they're total jerks.

He went to Burrito Boyz.  His only regret?  Not getting a large.

He's pretty much bang on.  There's very little to regret when it comes to Burrito Boyz.  Their burritos are big and filled to the point of bursting with delicious flavours.  I usually go for the small, because the large really is very large, but I'll indulge once in a while.

They've got a variety of meats you can choose from.  Some favourite being chicken, halibut and beef.

Everything is great really.  Even their level of spice, is always bang on for me.  You can request that they withhold certain things like hot sauce or jalopenos, but trust me, it's not that bad.",4.0
yR7mcnvyM2ky1xYUeim_Xw,"Mr Cool Heating and Air Conditioning came to the rescue for me on short notice AND was able to work on a swamp cooler, which many companies do not. 

We have three dogs of our own and we foster dogs, so when it started to heat up here in Vegas we were worried when the swamp cooler didn't seem to be blowing out air as cold as it normally does. I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help. 

Swamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again. I asked questions about how to best maintenance our swamp cooler and he was happy to answer. I'm very glad we chose Mr Cool and would HIGHLY recommend Derek as he was so patient, kind, and hardworking. Swamp coolers are a pain for repair so if they were affordable for our repair I'm sure they're even better with AC units. Thank you Derek and Mr Cool, our house gets soooo cold now, just how I like it!",5.0

Tv87VbmTrCVlGukNUvdAsQ,"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.

It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.

Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.",4.0

An extra star for the legendary Iraqi fish dish known as 'Masgoof.'  If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.

In most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.

The interiors and décor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.

I contacted him several times for him to get my car fixed he kept saying that he would fix it after the holidays. January, February passed the car was not fix yet. I contacted him one las time, I told him that I would give him one more month than he told me that he has been working on it still. He told me that it was an imported part witch was not easy to find. I told him I will take legal action and he than answered with '' do whatever you have to do'' with a arrogant tone so unprofessional till now I can say that he has NEVER!!! Contacted me!!! To keep me updated or give me a solution. I believe I have been more than patient at this time it is incredible how they claim to be a legal business.

In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, "" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy"".

I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills.

Doctor Youssef first helped my boyfriend when his cat had a horrible hairball stuck in her stomach. He shows so much compassion and understanding for animals it is hard not to believe he truly cares for their well being.

He is not afraid to tell you if you are harming your pet. If they are overweight, he will tell you straight up and let you know you are causing them harm. If you are an uptight suburbian, then don't go to him. He will tell you that you are killing your dog feeding them 'Puppocinos'. Which you are.

I started taking my dog here after she expressed her hatred of her previous vet, who felt that it was 'no big deal' and that they could always just muzzle her or sedate her for check ups. I felt that was ridiculous and brought her to Doctor Youssef who felt the same and is doing everything in his power to make her comfortable with him and his staff. He has even let me take her around the whole building just to get use to it. 

His prices are very fair, and he himself is the most trustworthy vet I have yet to meet. One conversation with him and you can tell he does not care about money, he is truly one of the very few who are in this business just because they care about animals.

We had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.

Fast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.

We called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as ""assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres"" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.

When we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. 

Needless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.

No big deal till you understand the rest.. this is a cheap way to not refill system and do it right...  After going to get my car when they said it was done I Notice AC didn't work and wrong Coolant added to Radiator. ( cannot use regular Green... Yellow Ford required ) Then I say I will come get it when they fix the AC, they tell me hours later its the PCM..( Computer ) well OK you guys shorted it out, the only thing wrong was a Valve Rattle, now this??

IT WAS NOT THE PCM.. this place MIGHT be good for a Oil Change if you tell them how to do it, but that's all..  Telling me How Do we know you didn't bring it in here like this...

A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as ""butter"" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!
The end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came.

Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed!

Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.

For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.

I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.

I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in. 
     I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave.

We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.
     After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are ""backed up inside"", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing.

Personally, I don't do cheap beer, and nothing else looked good, so I stuck with water. At this, she snickers, ""so just water and some apps.....MMMKAYY"" while giving stink eyes. Excuse me?

jslZnOFu2Oa-2MZ7Ud1O8g,"If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. 

Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard.",4.0

One didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no, it completely broke in less than a month. It won't even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly!

gCLbUG4PnhwhBKR_5jARjw,"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.
The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.

cYyE6CHzwJkDD6wukfit0A,"I loved my little cake, but the owner is her own worst enemy to her business. A friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day. He said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale. When I walked in the store, I didn't know who the owner was, until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I'm not going to buy a large cake. When we started talking a bit more, I could see her employees sort of clam up. I had no idea what was going on. When I chose my little cake, any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred.  She didn't even say, ""Thank you,"" It was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers. I was upset and quite frankly, so angry that I wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money. I am not rich - I am passionate about bakeries and tour around when I'm in a new town to support local business. I was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me. I had heard through other locals that they love the cakes, but not the owner when she's in the shop because she's so rude. I give this a two stars because I liked the cakes, but the service was very, very caustic that I could not justify scoring more. She cuts people off  - that was feedback I had received from previous customers. My local friends said that they cannot build rapport with the service workers there because there is always a new person. That made me wonder what was going on. I was trying to figure out how she stayed in business, but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic. I love the cakes there - the store is creative, but I sense a level of stress that turned me off. If it's the economy, that's one thing, but in the U.S., customer service is not taken lightly and I will probably seek out another Nothing Bundt Cakes for the product, but not return due to the principle of how rude the service was.",2.0

SVOxLL37tIeTzPEukht18g,"I had two different experiences with Carpet Monkey. In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze. Thank you Isaac and Rick!",5.0

R4ox2uOJsXHwRTODx0nKyg,"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us.

If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????",2.0

It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought.

The decor is trendy and interesting, it's Cleveland-centric, and they offer great vegan options. When our group entered the store, we were warmly welcomed and given an explanation of how everything worked. It's a per-ounce froyo place with lots of possibilities. I chose the artisan organic tart yogurt and the vegan blueberry...mmm. One thing to note is that because it's vegan (made with coconut milk), it's not as creamy and melts a bit quicker if you're not used to vegan things. Yum. 

They have lots of topping options, along with organic MOCHI and tons of fruit. They also have nutella and flavored bubbles! I usually go with the mochi and fruit with froyo, and all of it was very fresh.

We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise.
The experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good.
The flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible.

QpwGPaQT-KCsfnEnEaE5qQ,"To whomever owns Lucki Thai:   Lucki is actually spelled with a y.   Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.

I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.

I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  

Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   

The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.

I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?

But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.",5.0

pW0YWe0xoQQZIfc-NKvUnQ,"I was sent to Vision Source South Hills for a second opinion. I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: ""patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance"". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service.

Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the salon doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside everything is great. The facility is clean, but what makes the difference for me is the fact that the staff there was so friendly, and welcoming. All of the technicians were talking with the clients and there were even a few friendly group conversations between everyone in the salon. It was very comfortable! Most of the ladies in there during my appointment were regular clients and they had nothing but good things to say about the place after learning that it was my first time there. Loyal clientele is always a good sign. 
Johnny did my acrylic nails (full set) which I am totally in love with. He did a great job and was also really personable.

vsd6DoMG32MB6W-3Ht3b8A,"My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12"" x 12"" square and 10-12"" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8"" square base, next layer 6"" base and the top layer 4"" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4"" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2"" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.",1.0

The gentleman that showed up was instantly able to locate the problem and solution - terrible install design by the home builders - and my dad actually was able to make the repair with the technician's directions. The service charge was more than reasonable and I was just relieved to be able to continue using the AC. We just called them out again today to check our system as the vents do not blow equally throughout the house resulting in hot spots and cool spots. The very same technician came out and looked at our system again - and again all of our issues are due to how cheaply made the house was back in 1999 - and spent about 20 minutes teaching us how to have better air flow and utilize the vents in the house wisely.

While Savers deserves five stars, the adhesive on the back of the price tags is very hard to remove and the frustration level is palpable. When they put it on the inside of the shoe bottom, and you try to remove it, it leaves a gooey residue that is all but fun when you slip on a pair of shoes in warm weather and your foot is sweaty. Ignoring the schmuck sound when you lift up your foot to walk due to it sticking to the shoe, it doesn't feel very good.

You can put these price tags directly on leather and they don't stick because leather breathes. It's the synthetic material they use for the inside of shoes where adhesive really only does ""its thing"" leading to frustration.

Hey, look its Viva Mercados!

[my aunt] so you've been there?!

[me] No.. but lets try it.

Walking in the decor was the usual.. whats the word.. oh yes.. Festive. But then again thats what you find at every mexican restaurant.

Quick, friendly service. Lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before. Add, 1 more star.

Didn't try the chips, salsa or bean dip. I'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food. No, i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience. [yes, i know im just brilliant, no need for the pat on the back]

The food came and it was hot. It was delicious, mostly cause i was starving.. but it wasn't something that was spectacular. My mother in law makes better beans and rice. The taco cracked as soon as i took a bite. Thats another pet peeve. Inside I cried a little.. Now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out. Well, that ruined my taco experience. Boo. The chile relleno was delish. Cooked to perfections and de-seeded, just the way I like it. Adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno. Overall it was good

Would have given it another star but this place is way over priced. Can we say expensive. Especially because this place isn't on the strip. Their prices are the same as Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and they're portions aren't as big or as good. Sorry Viva Mercados, I will not be coming back.",3.0

607yTunGJNzx4v9iKhmTVw,"The first & most important thing you need to know is this place is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY, leave the kids at home because they are certainly not welcomed...they're allowed inside but make sure they leave any kind of expression of joy at the door before entering. 

Second thing to know, INDOOR VOICES ONLY. Whispered excitement guarantees you won't be asked to leave. Yes, it's a pinball arcade, but it's a ""MUSEUM"" pinball hall of fame. 

Third & last thing (I think) to know is not to expect favorable employee characteristics. At least not from the guy with the gray ponytail...especially not from him actually, maybe just avoid all contact with him if possible. 

Once you understand those 3 essential things you are sure to enjoy your time. With rows of pinball machines there is plenty to check out, the variety is not lacking. You can certainly stretch $10-20 into a good couple hours worth of play.

B4tz9-3R62_FFZDK5Ud0XA,"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.
Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. 
Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.
Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.
Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.
So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.",3.0

The Empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy, not dry at all. The street corn, which is a favorite of mine, was the best I have had so far. I can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor. We ordered sliced avocado, creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected. I love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean.

w8WLI9kVxcWi-H4W6j1f7A,"I will say that the unsalted edemame was not expected or appreciated. A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.

I thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.

As for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.

The service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.

There was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.

If you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back.",4.0
BleJTqbz6iRJudMrFOxQsg,"I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.
  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...
    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  
   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.
  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.

So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it.

Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger. 

They were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!

New Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard. 

The Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.

My other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well. 

Also we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point. 

The desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good. 

The oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it! 

So there you have it. 

The service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work. 

The location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food, I can see this place getting packed with the quickness.",2.0

I mean seriously I get bottle service every single time and I do not get there later than 10-1030 pm sure the club may still be empty but i would muchhh rather hang out at my sickkk table than wait in a line for 2 hours.

uNvd2Bzic2fVBh4EalsRJw,"Oddly enough, it was a negative Yelp review that drew me to Diamond's in the first place (a review I see is no longer on Yelp). But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love, the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw. 

I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog, but that was the last straw for me.

aRidF5IYq5VoK5oMgFu43Q,"When looking up hotels to stay in, I was skeptical about this and many other hotels, as one usually is in a city the've never visited. However, I was extremely pleased with my stay at Platinum.

Location: Located next to an AM/PM gas station. This was great because I could pregame on the cheap before we went to various places. The hotel is very visible but still in the cut. About a half mile or so from the Venetian.

Customer Service: When I walked in, I was greeted with warmth. It was about 1 am, so not many people were in the lobby. Which was actually the case throughout my entire trip. I chatted with the front desk associate like we were old friends. He was just that nice. And he made me feel so welcome!

Room: Can I tell you that this room was EVERYTHING in LIFE?! Ok. There I told you. I was in room 402 I believe. This room was in fact a suite. I felt like it was an apartment and I had a lease. Freaking HUGE! It had separate areas for a kitchen (complete with full fridge, stove / oven, microwave, dishwasher and bar), living room, balcony, bedroom with 2 queen beds, a safe, closet and tv and bathroom with closet, garden tub, separate bathroom and double sink vanity. The bathroom was the size of most rooms. Completely clean!!!!

I stayed in it by myself. What a wondrous time!!!!!!! I had everything I needed and then some. And the view! Perfect view of the strip. It's the perfect way to be a part of Vegas without all the noise and smoke you get in a hotel with a casino. At half the price. Or less, depending on when you go. My first night in Vegas was spent relaxing in my beautiful room.

Tip: Even if you can't go get a full massage or service at the spa, at least purchase a cupcake bath salt from them and use in that beautiful tub. So relaxing!

I will def be bringing my sister and cousin back this March! Can't wait!

D64a7grXSsW2P7hJi_oRXQ,"Great place.  We stayed at the Hermosa Inn, and dinner and breakfast at Lon's were included as part of our package.  We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday. 

We returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette, and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.

I'd say the quality of fish, rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale.

Also.... the water gets murky after a while.  Do you really want to go in there?  You would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or STDs.

_n1KOx4chiwrM5y_0m0IcQ,"This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

LBh-oRd5enTZBoNiKhHpmA,"BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken. I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning. 

Pros: 

* Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter 
* Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows
* Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) 
* Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw
   Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste
* Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. 
  Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) 
  We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming 
* Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable
* Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable
* Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken
* Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors 
  I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders 
* Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip
* Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks 

Cons: 

* It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.

 Its more American Mexican food but it was good!

The service I recieved was 5 stars. Everyone was nice, I noticed there was mostly teenagers working there, and they were very friendly and helpful.  They checked up on us to make sure everything was alright, but they weren't overly obtrusive to where you feel bothered.  They put some restaurants to shame, and this isn't even that type of restaurant.

We eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner.  The chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious.  For entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak.  Everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right.  They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right.  Fortunately, for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was.  She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain.  The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.  Even though I would probably never order the steak again, we will definitely be back for the ambience, the drinks, the other yummy food, but most of all for the EXCELLENT customer service that is so rare to find these days.

QzH5dmXI5VY5i-mXCZ6Rzw,"I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. 

We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) 
- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) 
- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)
- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  
- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. 
- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! 
- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) 
- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! 
- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  

***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol 

OVERALL RATINGS:
Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)
Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! 
Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio
Presentation - 4 stars
Service & Ambiance - 4 stars

I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!",4.0
wjtpC1_-RNPyOnrQQ62lDg,"4 stars means I'm a fan, and yes Id agree with that. However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real! 

So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. 

Okay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. 

Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.

Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.

The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. 

The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. 

Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!

This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!",4.0
cSkzuxDxW87T5ojzedITaA,"I have purchased two carpets here and went for my third today. The first two worked out just fine. You save a little money by having very limited customer service but it has good variety as long as you are good with looking on your own. 

Today we found a carpet we wanted and asked the sales guy to come over to price it out. It is an 8x10 and he gave the price, we agreed and then he went to write us up. When we went to pay, I noticed the price was different that the quote from 10 minutes ago by about $40. He said I needed to buy 8x12 instead because they don't have a use for the other 2"". Well, neither do I, this was not in the agreed upon price and it is a remnant so they can cut however they want. 

The bottom line here is that they were not honest and did not honor the direct quote given. Most of all, it feels like they are taking advantage of people by giving a price and then changing it without telling you. 

Good carpet variety but a lack of integrity and honesty. Maybe it is a new guy but the owner didn't help. Be careful that the price they give is the same when you pay the bill.",2.0

My personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe. Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato. Combine that with melted cheese, sour cream, and other delicious toppings, this potato can't be beat!

I'm so glad I called Diane and after talking to her on the phone I felt confident that she was the one who would take over caring for my little ones.

TLtehTkEN271rINcsyjk5Q,"I honestly didn't find this place to be all that.  Don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but I can find better made items that Honey Salt offers for way cheaper price.  The only good thing that I was blown away by is their Fried Calamari.  That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap ""free range"" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.  

Again, overall the place is well lit and looks great.

miNlxoNM15-lH7KE5fwDgQ,"Remember 98 South Wine Bar?... or the 2nd 98 South Wine Bar?... or Fat Cat?  That space in Downtown Chandler has a new tenant, and they seem like a keeper.  DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters.

Looks:  Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art.  I like it.  It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned.  There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted.  The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains.

Crowd:  Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night.  A wide mix of young and old.

Food:  My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house.  The salad was solid.  I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.  Maybe that was a fish story.

Value:  Here's where I thought this place shined.  Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.

Service:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.  (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.)  Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks.  I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't.

Miscellaneous:  A lot of decisions haven't been made yet.  Will they serve lunch?  What will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind.)  Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.

Verdict:  I don't go out for steaks often, even reasonably priced ones, but I'll definitely be back to DC Steakhouse to see my new ""friends.""  I've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time.",4.0

Sherrie was the girl that always did my laser and it was comfortable to be around. As my six treatments went up, I signed up and made a new package, and then soon again, those six were up, and I signed up again. THIS TIME THOUGH, I spoke to Monica before I signed anything. I wanted to make sure I would get a refund for any treatments if Sherrie was to leave or if they were to move locations because I was well aware that their policies are not very consumer-friendly. Well, guess what? They moved locations and nobody told me and my appt. had been cancelled. I called Neos to see what the deal was and Brian was super rude and said he would never agree to a refund, even though it is written in my chart. He said he can ""make it worth my while"" to drive all the way to another office which is 45 minutes from my house when I was only driving 20 to Peoria. He offered me a free microderm... I'm 20 and I told him I don't want one and he said that he would suggest it since my face needs a ""detailing"".... If that isn't rude I don't know what is. It gets better because he told me his tech Charlene is great and that she is BETTER then Sherrie and has a lot more experience. I did not think that it was professional to talk trash about former employees... especially when I have done so many  treatments with them. I have requested my chart to be faxed to me and nobody has gotten back to me. I had two treatments left and he wouldn't refund those treatments, even though I have been a loyal customer for so long.

3Gh-BxQK-jZnWG6alGoiUA,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2.0

eQYh6Q4FXgNBd9fvtnVC1A,"Their web site lured me in, impressive as it is... ""Largest service fleet in the area... etc. etc."" 

They said they could fix our LG washer, but then they didn't stock the parts, had to special order them, and when the new parts were installed, the machine didn't work.

Well, they get ZERO stars for not fixing the washer. They get ZERO stars for charging us for a service call when they had no real solution. They were kind enough to remove the new (bad? wrong?) parts, and to refund our money for them. 

But then, THEY GAVE UP, blaming LG for being a crappy company, and suggesting we buy a Whirlpool. Well, maybe that's true, and probably a good suggestion, although this $900 washer was highly recommended by Consumer Reports about five years ago, when we bought it. You would think if they are authorized to repair LG washers, that they would do a better job at customer service. 

Now I have to call LG, file a complaint, and find a *real* solution provider. This is a real *hassle* I don't need right now. 

Whatever happened to the old, ""We'll get it right, or you don't pay a dime!"" guarantee? Does anyone still offer that in the Appliance Repair category?

My father in law passed away late Friday, June 2nd. We went to the funeral home at 12 noon Saturday June 3rd to make arrangements for his visitation, funeral and graveside service. We left after 2pm and went to another florist in the area that was a friend of the family. No offense to that florist, her selections were slim pickings and she didn't seem too accommodating since she was low on fresh cut flowers because of ""prom weekend"". My wife was so upset because she wanted the perfect flower arrangement for her ""daddy"".

We began calling to realize that florist shut down and close shop early on Saturdays. I also know that sometimes a shop owner will still be around working, even though the shop is closed. I called Talley's and left a message... it was a shot in the dark. My wife didn't want to wait until Monday to figure this out when the visitation was scheduled for that evening. 

After about 20 minutes of giving up, my phone rang... it was Amy! She took the time to talk with us outside of business hours. She was sympathetic and compassionate towards us and our circumstances. We trusted her expertise and experience to provide us with an beautiful flower/plant combination.

We arrived to the funeral home Monday evening and looked for the flower/plant arrangement. WOW! It was so beautiful! My wife started crying. It was exactly why she wanted.

Amy went above and beyond for us. Her expert knowledge combined with taking the time to listen to us to understand our wishes produced an amazing arrangement. She is an example of what your floral experience should be. We would recommend Amy and Talleys Florist with full knowledge of how she interacts with actual customers.",5.0

This casino is about a 15-20 minute drive from the strip.

We were immediately greeted with the large screens in preparation for the Super Bowl.  They even had the volume turned up so that people in the area could listen.  They also had some TV's over the blackjack tables which was where we spent the second half watching the game. 

There's also an aquarium and aquarium-themed restaurant in which they have a [fake] mermaid swimming in the aquarium and then people can take pictures with her afterwards.  There were TV's in the restaurant showing the Super Bowl as well.

And If you sign up for a players card, you get a free buffet (which we didn't take advantage of, though).

S5GJKEGXAKtFrYaQC8Fuqw,"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus ""tapas"" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the ""Halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.

We ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80). The Malaysian Curry was delicious but really, really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl). If you're fine with that (which I was), you'll probably still enjoy it. The sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast, crispy and buttered). It was stuffed with everything it promised, but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards. With the tea, it was a great, comforting Saturday morning meal!

But back to my review...so I came at 12:30 with my boyfriend and we promptly ordered a caesar, a bellini, an order of donuts, the duck scramble, and the two egg breakfast. Yes, we're fatsos at heart. 

The drinks came in a timely manner, as did the donuts. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. AND WAITED. We are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food, but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! It was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive. Definitely unimpressed with the service. 

As for the food itself, I'd call it 'decent'. The donuts were delicious, but the chocolate mousse-like dip it came with was rather tasteless. Actually, I actively didn't like the chocolate dip and I LOVE chocolate. My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes, but everything else just...normal. 

Honestly, the best part about this place, in my opinion, is that it takes brunch reservations. I like the decor inside and it's apparently a very popular drink spot, but I probably won't be back for brunch unless all I want is an order of potatoes and a bellini.",3.0

We walked in around 6:30pm on a Friday night,  the restaurant was about half filled. There were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door.  We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  We politely ask if we could move to the front.  The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .  
We were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  It is a sweet butter with orange zest.  
We were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side.   The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). 
I was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all.  
On the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good!

Torres I found out I was pregnant in July  but ended up  having a miscarriage in September . few appointments that I had with him he was very cold shouldered and I didn't feel he was really listening to what I had to say about my pregnancy that far. apparently after my 1st blood tests my estrogen was low so he prescribed me Progesterone 100 milligrams once a day. things didn't work out so come end of September I ended up scheduling a D&C. at that appointment he expressed that I probably have an estrogen issue since this was my 2nd miscarriage. He didn't know that by now????? smh...already frustrated with this location & this doc I was told I had to get went a follow-up. I did & he didn't even check me (didn't undress), he only asked me a few questions anything wrong, if I was trying to get pregnant again right away, if I want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit. This doc didn't seem to care about my well being and didn't care enough to take better precautions with my blood results. oh & while he was asking me questions before my surgery he answered a personal call in front of me...he was talking about his hurt hip, a trip aka vacation, that he feels better now & he got rest... then slowly walked out of my room. horrible!!! the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus.

8PV3gt3I8oOZj6gCeF6Sbw,"This is my favorite place to go for sushi, because of the ambiance, service, and overall quality of the menu items. 

The ambiance is welcoming (literally, with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting, as per Japanese tradition), and it never gets too busy or over-crowded, so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever. It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.

Since the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.

The fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever. Other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented. There are even local nods to the Flames, with the 'Red Mile Roll,' and 'Red Hot Flames Rolls.'

A mainstay for meal options when I'm traveling, Fresh has fresh bowls, juices and more. Yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything.  When I come for healthy vegan food, that's all I really want. I don't care for the vegetables to be made into unrecognizable too small, creative portions. With that being said, Fresh still has some interesting spins on their menus, most notably the quinoa onion rings which are out of this world!

qTytqg0Y7GcQpDt93FSIQw,"I swear if the serving size was more this place could be a easy 4 1/2 Stars. My husband and I along with our boys were in SC last weekend for scheduled maintenance on one of our SUV's and since the appointment was so early we rushed out without breakfast so of course the entire time in the waiting area we were searching for food. 
This place was bookmarked by me so we went to check it out after seeing the menu had Vegan options and our boys and I are Vegan. 
We arrived and Boy was this place busy, people standing outside waiting for tables and all. I went in to see how the list worked and there was a sheet of paper on the landing with no one manning it and several sets of people in the extremely small (6ppl capacity) entry way. I flagged down a server who then came to take my name and others waiting name down and explained to us all at once how the long table in the middle worked. Basically the table is 1st come 1st served and adding your name to the list put you on wait for the tables around the room on the outer perimeter. We were told 30min so we sat in the car and my husband went inside every 10mins to see if we were coming up since they don't take numbers nor do they have buzzers. I totally don't mind this process at all it seems more down to earth and not commercial. 
After about 40 plus minutes we got a table and were so hungry and I ordered the chef special vegan dish which was the only Vegan dish on the list. I was immediately told that the chef special was SOLD OUT and that happened about a half hour before I ordered (meaning if we had a seat I wouldn't got to have it ). Mind you it was only like 11:30am *insert Kanye shrug* 

I read on the specials menu that there was a skillet with lots of yummy veggies that I enjoy and some type of meat, I asked if the skillet could be made for me minus the meat. The waitress agreed so that's what I ordered. My husband ordered a veggie egg while omelet dish with a sweet potato waffle. Our toddler had pancakes and fruit. 

Look I'm honest so here is the run down on what you we had:

Skillet (cauliflower, squash, sweet potato & red peppers) - This  we super tasty but extremely small.
Egg white omelet with veggies(Goid)
Sweet potato waffle - Hubby wasn't impressed he stated it was to soft and the texture wasn't what he expected.

D3vieRpv7g5o0WYQqa6VoQ,"My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, ""International Market? That looks interesting.""  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, ""$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!""

So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.

Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.

After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.

I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them.",5.0

Slq7ppnKQjwR-6LSYLNuzg,"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.

DQbpZJQRMEDZcqbklqvOQw,"AWFUL AWFUL PEOPLE! I'm only giving them one star because I can't post otherwise, but they're not even worth that. I used MovingAPT.com to find them - won't ever use them again either. I thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening. I don't even know where to start with my complaints; this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism. I paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano. 

When they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano. My dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. This is a stage piano, the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! After loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (Virginia), my stuff is taken from Wyoming to Seattle, then back to Vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. I only found out because I kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so I could plan accordingly. After repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey East. 

Finally, they call to tell me they'll be there on June xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window I said I would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered BEFORE the contract was even signed. So I'm told if I can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they'd go on to New York with my stuff and I'd have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). After they had unloaded everything and AFTER I had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don't have anything to move the piano. So they decide they'll go to Home Depot, hire random men, and carry/lift the piano into my house. You don't LIFT a piano! So my friend that's there says no, it's too heavy, you need the proper equipment, I suggest you go find it. So then they tell him that they need to get on the road to New York for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until I was back so I'd let them deliver it. Again, they're told no, at which point the driver calls me while I'm in the airport and says if I don't let them into my house I'd have to pay a second delivery fee. I told them not to leave the state with my piano and I'd call them right back - so I call my friend and ask what's going on; he gives me the scoop. I asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til I could get a professional. He said OK, and while I'm still on the phone, I hear him say exactly that to the driver. I call the driver back myself and say the same thing. I literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said OK. My friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, ROLLED it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, DROPPED it, eventually go it inside, and we're RUNNING TO THEIR TRUCK when my friend gets back. They hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. He had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped. At that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again. 

As soon as I got home that same evening I went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures. I called the driver and asked what had happened. He said nothing, everything was fine, no damage. I called BS and told him I'm standing in my living room looking at the damage. He hung up and I've never been able to get a hold of these people since.",1.0

Long line to get tickets meant standing outside in the sun.  No kiosks.  Screen, sound and chairs were good.  Way too hot.  I've never walked out of a theatre with swamp ass before.  10 mins of commercials prior to the ""start time"" followed by another 30 mins of previews.

FJcT1mTMl5dqg56vKA2A3Q,"Some notes: restaurant is located in the Esplandade with the AMC cinema and to the east of the Ritz Carleton.  Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.  

That being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.

Greeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as ""XL"".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.  

Nice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!

TROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.

Drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!

Entrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.

I'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!

Was my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.

Huge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!

Bonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!

So at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had ""hid"" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.  (BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25)

03_9Pt4J7-jqjXdJah35kg,"I took my daughter to see Dr Lederman in the Glendale office as she was needing a shoulder replacement. I was told he is the best. My daughter has multiple disabilities from a TBI. She only has the use of that one arm/shoulder. Of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment. He said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery. He suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain. Then the next appointment with Dr Lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain, my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard. Shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain. Then she was prescribed with pain meds. This went on another few years. She was crying in pain everyday and in the night too. I massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution I could find besides taking the pain meds. She cried and  ""begged"" me to cut off her arm several times. We finally went back to Lederman again. This time my daughter refused to take no for an answer...she wanted the surgery. Dr Lederman left the room and came back in saying ""I'm not the man for job. Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI."" Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one. My daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it. He did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart.

zU3oPhDmsOhIcfIXjaAdwQ,"Came here with a group of 20+ to see Morgan Page on 11/30/12.

Arrival: Got to the club around 11pm. Getting to the club was simple, took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)! 

Entry: Got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1:1 (guy/girl) comp until midnight. Sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on. The entry line was confusing as hell, with at least 4 different lines (staff, promoter, general, VIP). There was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed. This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn't. Whatever, lesson learned. Don't rush in. Don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you're approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don't listen to otherwise!

Club Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It's beautiful.

Bar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you'll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.

Overall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5.",4.0

Jq10w1aWcf0cxBw-caixkg,"It use to be that when I have my annual vacation to Vegas with either my girlfriends or husband, Koi was the place to go to get my sushi needs. 

Ever since I went to Social House, I certainly changed my mind about going to Koi again!  

My girl friend and I went to Social House last Saturday a little before 5, before the restaurant opened for dinner.  The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their ""Socialite"" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their ""lycheetini"".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have. 

When it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called ""hana awaka""....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new! 

The food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.  

Everyone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.   

The ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation.

g_-16KV8WRofocPT9QHAnw,"I want to start by saying that the staff there are all very friendly and knowledgeable, however I have not had a good experience there.

I have a chronic eye condition that requires me to get a hard contact lens for one eye. Typically I had to go to Oakland to get all this done and I wanted to see if I could find somewhere closer to home. I got new glasses, lenses and a new hard lens here.

First they lost the order for my eyeglasses. They never realized this until about a month after my visit and I called having not heard anything. When I got them the prescription was far too strong and they had to back it off. So getting my glasses took over two months.

For my hard lens it took time to get that correct as well, but that is expected. It also took me several times asking my Oakland optometrist to get my records faxed to them. McCauley-Celin at first said they never received them, but they then found them in another computer system. When the first lens didn't fit quite right I went to the Wexford office to get it checked and left my lens there as it needed to be returned. When my new lens came they asked for my old one and apparently it was lost out there or somewhere. I paid for my lens with my FSA account but then was told that it should be covered under my insurance and that they would take care of it. That didn't happen so I called to ask about it. They never got back to me so I went to their Gibsonia office and they said that they owed me money and it was fixed. This all again took several months.


If you just need glasses and lenses and are fairly routine in your needs, you'll probably be fine. But I'm going back to Oakland I guess. The office staff just can't handle anything.",2.0

It also gives you a bar so you can just sit at and enjoy drinks that have been made by the bartender. It offers a variety of food. From entrees like burgers, steak, and fish, and if you are not feeling to hungry then they have appetizers like hot wings, sliders, chips and salsa and so many more options. Also they allow you to order your food from home and pick it up and take it home. I personally like that there is so many options to choose from on the menu. I like how they also cater to the needs of someone trying to be healthy and watch their diet by adding healthy items to the menu. The staff is great and helpful. They don't hang around, and watch you eat. They check in at appropriate times to refill your drinks and ask how you're doing. The only thing I dislike is the waiting time. I usually have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. But that is because I usually go on the weekends, so it is understandable. I would give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars.",4.0

ms2vpymhegH4-_VkL5myEw,"7/15/17. Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. 

As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. 

We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said ""this happens all the time."" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). 

Alexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. 

Thank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables.

2kld_rZ4dv8-UoKIlmcnmQ,"This is my go-to grocery store when I am too lazy to head to Winco. I have been here well over a hundred times, and the experience is pretty standard for Smith's stores in my experience.

I have never had a problem with stocking here, which is good. Items are always stocked well, regardless of when in the week you come. I am not the biggest fan of their produce however. About 20% of the time, I bring how green beans or asparagus, and two days later they are covered in mold (and no, it is not my refrigerator). So I no longer purchase produce here except for when I am in a bind. Store is also always clean, I have never once seen a spill or poorly arranged merchandise, which is a testament to the hard working staff. 

The staff are always very helpful and friendly. They don't always have enough baggers, but last time I was there they had plenty, and wouldn't even let me unload my cart (they had a separate person in the aisle that unloaded people's carts for them). First time I've experienced that and it was pretty great. 

Prices are a bit on the high side overall, I would not shop here if you do not use your Smith's card. The prices are outrageous with out it. However, they end up being pretty reasonable when you remember to use the gas points (which is now made easier by the Smith's gas station located directly in front of this store). 

They DEFINITELY need way more cart corrals in the parking lot. Like at least double the amount they currently have. There are none closer to the gas station, and when the store is busy people are too lazy to walk their carts back to the corrals, and I've seen carts fly into parked cars on at least three separate occasions. I hope Smith's management reads this review and fixes this problem soon.",4.0

DMdqVhEEzd4hU9nV_YOKWg,"Nestled in what is (for now) a relatively sleepy corner of Downtown, Urban Bodega (aka URBO) feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores I used to see line the Roosevelt Row neighborhood.  Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.

You'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.

For my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.

So there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case.",4.0

I had some minor issues with it, first being that there was just a little too much aioli on the bread and second that the fried tomato was a red tomato and not a green tomato. I just found the texture of the tomato unappetizing. I also enjoyed their bloody mary and they have a nice local, craft beer selection.

I can say nothing but positive things about my experience at fitness together Steele creek. The facility is clean and well equipped and the staff is knowledgeable and full of personality. When my wife and I first showed up, we had a deal to try five sessions for 99 dollars. We had talked for a while about joining a gym, but fitness together is so much more. It's like a community of people working toward a common goal of getting fit and taking control of their health. The owner, Joe, is very knowledgeable in fitness, exercise, and most importantly nutrition. He worked with us to set up individual  nutrition plans and exercise programs to help us attain our goals. Included with your sessions purchase is a fitness assessment which measures body fat percentage, fitness levels, resting heart rate, flexibility, and a few other factors. Additional assessments are given throughout your tenure as a fitness together member so you can watch your total body transformation. It is a very encouraging atmosphere no matter your current level of fitness. At first I dreaded going to exercise, but after seeing the positive changes you just can't wait to get back. I like the fact that sessions can be purchased in packages without a long term commitment, but I must say I continue to add additional sessions. This is mainly because I continue to see results. My wife and I are both stronger, healthier, and happier thanks to Joe and his knowledgeable and helpful staff.

The food was very good and the drinks were fantastic but more importantly the service was outstanding.

We all started with cocktails - Margaritas and Mojitos.  The Margarita was made with bourbon and rimed with crushed bacon and salt (yes I said bacon).  The Mojitos were fresh and minty.  The one thing I we all really like about the drinks was that they were not too sweet.  

We ordered two apps for the table - Lobster Fritters and Braised beef short rib poutine.  OMG the poutine was out of this world!!  The fritters were good but there was no lobster flavor.  I think next time I would just order the vegetable fritters.

For mains we had fried fish tacos, steak burrito, jambalaya and grilled pork chop with red potato salad.  The jambalaya and the pork chop were features. The burritos was very nice.  The steak was a nice medium rare and it came with guacamole and lime crema.  Fish Tacos were delish!  The corn tortillas really make a difference.  The pork chop feature was really good.  My friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect.  The only dish that fell short was the Jambalya.  The sausage in the dish had great flavor but the overall dish didn't seem to come together.  

You would think by now we would be full but we sucked it up and ordered dessert. Two sweet potato pies, beignets and a Patron creme brulee.  My word it was good. The sweet potato pie was more of a bread pudding with a bourbon carmel sauce.  The creme brulee was one of the best I've had - it had a lovely fresh citrus flavor.  The beignets were tougher than I expected but still good.

I would like to point something out about this place.  No the food isn't cheap but the quality of the ingredients justifies the cost.  Our meal with tax and tip was $200 (for four).  The food was really good but what sets them apart is the service.  The restuarant was fairly busy and there was only one waiter who had the assitance of the owners Amy and Albert.  Yes there were times when we seemed to be waiting awhile for things but they made sure that we never felt forgotton.  They went out of their way to talk to us and make us feel welcome.  I've been to some really nice restaurants and had some incredible food but I've never been made to feel as welcome as did at The Combine Eatery.",5.0

DGBYjQt0PhqOmjM53eqtJA,"We arrived here at 10:00am and weren't able to get a full tour until 1:00pm, so we opted for the mini tour.

It was very informative and interesting. It starts with a brief video about the dam which lasts about 10 minutes. Then you are led to a line where you wait for your tour to begin. The take you down the elevator into the depths of the dam. You get to see all the workings and information about how it was built. The our guides are entertaining as well- as dam entertaining as you can be about a dam tour. LOL

After the tour concludes you are allowed to walk outside and see the dam from a great viewpoint. Awesome time to take pictures and really enjoy the massive beauty of this place. There is also a small exhibit inside which tells you more about how Hoover Dam was built and what it took. It is so amazing that people built this place so long ago and the horrendous conditions they had to endure. just standing outside in late July- temperatures topped 106 but in the sun it felt like 120.

Once you are done exploring the inside exhibits and views, you can wander outside and walk the dam. Beware that when you leave the dam touring area, you cannot return, it is a one way only exit. 

I recommend bringing lots of waters and hats, as the heat made exploring the dam outside almost unbearable.

After checking the outside of the dam, we walked over to little souvenir shop and bought some items. By that time, we were hot and starved, so we stopped at the small deli/snack shop at the dam and snagged a table to eat lunch. Beware it can get very crowded. We ordered a small deli sandwich and some chicken tenders/fries for the kids.

TIP: Bring your own bagged lunch and sit on the shaded areas/benches during your walk of the dam to really enjoy the experience. There is a Subway on your drive in to stop at.

This was a memorable, amazing visit and is one of those places you see that you will remember forever.",5.0

Yet, over time, Petal has begun to bring in a more varied selection that appeals to a wider, stylish market. While they still offer the $300-$450 cocktail dresses, they also showcase a variety of merchandise in the $75-$100 range. Plus, if you can catch them on a sale day, it's worth a trip.

Brand wise, you'll find upscale brands like Shoshanna, Amanda Uprichard, Alice & Trixie, Frock by Tracy Reese, James Jeans, Anlo and Citizens for Humanity.

Last month while I was in Las Vegas, I did a very quick trip just to watch my beloved Hawaii Warriors play football against UNLV.

While I was in Las Vegas, I decided to go up with just a duffle bag for my luggage, as I was basically away for just 2.5 days.

As a professional traveler, I like to travel light, and if I take something with me on a trip..........I'll be sure to use it! 
Don't you just hate it when you over-carry stuff & not use it? I've learned over the years from all my travels for work to ""travel efficiently"", and I hate carrying extra stuff.........because all you're doing is lugging excessive weight!

How does the Post Office come into play? 

Well, on my trip I decided to got to Trader Joe's (It's a Hawaii thing.........we don't have TJ in Hawaii).

But that's not it gang..........sure, I could have carried some of the stuff I bought home (which I did), but due to security, & TSA rules.........if you buy anything ""liquid"" or ""paste"" it cannot be over 3 oz. when you do any kind of carry on.

Catch my drift???

So after buying a few bottles of cookie butter for my sweetie (she likes that stuff), I realized I could not carry that onto the plane with me, so the next best thing to do.............yes gang! Go to the US Post Office, get one of them free - ""Flat Rate"" Boxes, load up all your junk that you bought (and make sure you pack it carefully if it's fragile), then tape it up.........and ship it out to yourself! In this case.........back to da 808!

Whaaaalaaaah! Not only was it cheaper to ship (even cheaper than paying for airline luggage, which usually runs from $25 to $35 dollars), but you don't have to carry it home either! What a smart Hawaiian I am 'eh!!!!! Lol!

So if you folks ever load up on omiyagi when you travel..............may I suggest this method to work around the dilemma you're in.

Just an FYI..........

Large Flat Rate Box cost only $17.90 to ship. If it fits........you can ship! 

Medium Flat Rate Box cost only $12.65 to ship. And again..........if it fits........you can ship!

This Post Office also has a automated kiosk, which is nice, because to can still ship items out when the post office is closed, or say you come here on a Sunday to ship something out (when the post office is closed).

I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must've answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say ""hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!"" Much more personal.

Anyhow, on to the food!!

We started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.

Main Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.

We had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the ""canon"" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called ""bubble and squeak."" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.

For dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.

Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing.
Chocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined. 
Dear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful. I gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs. Their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years. I'll be shocked if they stick around.",2.0

Is the Chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative?
I am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings. On new year last though, Bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine.

LdJ3Ktxs0SaPuLxMpxsCuQ,"My wife and I flew out to Vegas for the 3-Day President's Day weekend and my 50th birthday.
I reserved the car on-line at Hertz a few days earlier: A Mercedes C-Class from the prestige collection. I selected the Reserve This Exact Model option so that we would get a Mercedes.  I also signed up for the Hertz Gold membership so that our car would be ready for us and we would be able to skip the usually long counter lines at the McCarran Airport.  
None of these things happened. 
Our reservation was for 3:00.  At 2:48 I received an email confirmation that my car was ready for me and even given a stall # to find the car and license plate # to identify the car and even the color-white.  When we got to the stall there was a car, but not the car I had reserved and received confirmation for.  So, I explain my situation to a couple of workers that were walking by and they tell me that there was a Mercedes there earlier but somebody else got it.  Somebody else got it?  It was in a stall reserved for me, right?
Ok, over to the office to STAND IN LINE anyway.  The counter worker tells me there are no Mercedes available.  I say I reserved one specifically (Choose Exact Model), one was supposedly waiting for me, and I had received an email telling me this.
He tells me he has a better car for me:  A Cadillac.  We go out to see the Cad and I see a Mercedes, a white one, and I ask for it.  He tells me it's held for someone.  I say Yah, me.  He says he can't do it.  I ask why not.  He says it's on hold for someone else.
I ask why the car I had on hold went to someone else and he could not explain it.
We look at the Cad and he tells me there are two to choose from and I would like it better than the Mercedes anyway.  Is that why there were 2 Cadillacs and 0 Mercedes available?
Anyway, I agreed to take the Cadillac but was left wondering what is so great about Hertz and their Gold Club?  I had to wait in line, I did not get the car I reserved and was PROMISED.

His eyes close a bit, his mouth waters profusely, and he makes that mouthwatering gargling sound.  Do you have the image in your head?  Well, that's probably me exactly when I think about eating at Jimmy's!  It's so delicious that whenever I think about it, I have an instant craving!

The amount of food you get for the price is unbelievable!  The donairs and shawarmas are so big I struggle to finish one.  Even when I'm stuffed to the brim, I can't bring myself to throw any away, so I always make myself sick by force feeding the remaining wrap into my mouth.  I wouldn't for one second dream of wasting a Jimmy donair.  I know that everyone who goes here will all be saying the same thing: it's so delicious and marvelous that nothing else will ever be satisfying again!

The first time I went in here I had no clue what I was doing or what I wanted to eat.  Lucky for me, Jimmy was behind the counter serving people and he pointed me in the right direction of something yummy.  He was super friendly and extremely helpful.  Don't tell Jimmy but I kind of have a little crush on him.  Maybe that's why I keep going back.  Nah, it's because of how fantastic the food is.

Besides the donairs and shawarmas, they also have a bunch of little desserts you can buy.  There is a whole display of baklava and other yummy looking treats.  Along with the food, Jimmy's is also a great place to go if you want to buy some shisha or hookah pipes.  They have a large assortment of different sizes and shapes, and all the flavours that you can imagine smoking.

I seriously love Jimmy's so much.  I miss the days when a friend used to live behind the store and we ate there almost everyday.  Now I have to go a little out of my way to get there, but it's totally worth it every time.  I love Jimmy's so much and I'm positive that everyone who goes there loves it too.  It's just one of those awesome finds that everyone in the world should know about.  *insert Homer Simpson drooling here*",5.0

My good friend loves the place and found it a few years before. So he recommended a few things, we had a bottle of Riesling with our baked Bree and blackberry (I think it was jam) it was amazing. Truly, and I am very particular about the types of cheese I'm okay with (food allergies)



We were just catching up, so we didn't decide immediately that we would stay for dinner, but, why not, I choose the pasta with lobster in an amazing carrot butter sauce and he had the standing Shepard's pie, you have to see it to believe how amazing it is. 



Our food was amazing, we had a second bottle of wine, which was also amazing and although my friend finished all of his food, I've never been able to finish a full plate of pasta in one sitting, so I brought some home. I actually ate the left overs, which is unlike me.

The staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical Indian fare.
We shared the appetizers, the garlic Naan and vegetable samosas, both were an enjoyable beginning.  I love eggplant, so my go to order is the Baingan Bharta with rice and that is what I had.  It was delicious, I ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick.  I restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal.

The platter had 2 dolomades, that were very good and had a nice mint flavour behind the grape leaf. The house made sausage had loads of lemon zest in it and was exceptionally flavourful. Spanakopita was flaky, buttery and delicious and the octopus was nice, too. I have to say that the calamari was not as tender as I would have expected, but it wasn't terrible. They also brought us some delicious hummus that was made with fresh chickpeas. They also brought a nice helping of yummy tatziki on a plate.

AOfwC_Y7-Nh2MYZEzaDkNg,"Active Renter manages all my property in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I chose them over several other companies because they are honest, hard-working individuals who operate their business with integrity and professionalism.  They manage my property so well I never have to worry about the details.  And as an out-of-state property owner, I don't want to worry and have extra hassles!  They take care of everything, every step of the way.  Their communications are clear, concise, timely, and professional.  I will never switch and go to another company because I am so convinced I am getting honest and impeccable service from Active Renter, at a very reasonable cost.

As for the tenants who are complaining, I am hard-pressed to believe that Rich and the entire Active Renter crew have treated anyone poorly or have not serviced rentals in a timely manner. There are also people who tear up property (not their property!!) and then complain when they get billed for all the damages.  These are probably the same tenants who punch holes in dry wall, steal furnaces (who DOES that!?!?!?!), damage landscaping, tear up concrete driveways, etc.  - and then later complain when they are held accountable for the damages they created.  It's said that people who have negative comments are much more likely to post a review than people with positive comments - on a 9 to 1 basis!  So for every complaint, remember there are dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands of individuals who have wonderfully positive things to say about Active Renter, but just don't take the time to post a review.

From either the property management or the leasing side, I don't think you'll get better service anywhere than Active Renter provides.  I would recommend them - WITHOUT RESERVATION - to any family member, friend, and/or colleague.  They are the best in the business and their high rate of growth is proof positive they are the best property management company around.  You can't go wrong with Active Renter.  They are the real deal.

If I could give them 10 stars, I would!  They are that awesome!

P. S.  And I just have to add that the individuals who are posting negative comments sound childish and immature in their reviews.

When you join they do snake a few charges on you that you don't expect but everybody who gets your credit card does that nowadays don't they? Basic membership probably comes out to around $170 a year and that's not bad at all. 

I've been to this Gym around 40 times in the last couple of months. I've never seen any member nor staff clean the equipment so make sure you wipe down before your set. They do have staff clean the facility, empty trash, fix broken equipment which is the way it should be. 

The Gym gets very crowded at times, I think the local football team got a discount to workout there lol. So yeah, on weeknights there's a bunch of high schoolers ""working out"" their smartphones trying to be cool in front of their friends. Still, when it's super crowded I can usually get my workout in, I just have to be flexible and creative. If the place was empty it'd be really boring so there's always a positive spin to everything. 

Almost everybody behaves and they're willing to share equipment. There's no problem with the staff, they are definitely friendly which is a big plus.

 I ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens. It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.

I ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.

On another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how ""When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion."" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.

I've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience. However, the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (Tiramisu).

The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of ""I'm sorry!""s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation?

Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater.

VVAt1d3XNGb4-O_QLAN4Bg,"A co-worker of mine kept talking about Tottie's, so last night I finally gave it a try.  I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up.  I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter.  They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley.  They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about.  I also really want to try the soups, they sound good.  

All in all, it was good (I keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big.  I have enough for lunch leftovers today.  So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back.",4.0

The women at the front was flustered that I didn't have an appointment t when I asked if I could get a gel manicure and when again their were no customers. Never did I feel so unwelcome. I thought about leaving.

Finally, they took me. The nail tech complained about the gel on my nails and how tough it was to get off. She struggled with it.

EmDJPXFBhR3FOz8olSLNTg,PVSEC was amazing when our family dog was attacked by a deer. They took excellent care of our dog and provided constant updates and visits to make us feel as comfortable as possible during a traumatic time. The staff and doctors were wonderful. I was even able to call in the middle of the night and speak to a staff member about how our dog was doing. Everyone clearly loves animals who worked there and made it as easy as possible on our family. They even provided help locating another 24 hour emergency clinic when our dog relapsed a few months later while we were on vacation out of state.

CqMNjtG0hNZGhDw4RDE-zw,"I was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the ""artisan board"" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area.

This particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.

The seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.

Sometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entrée, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.

First of all, I called 5 different times to see if I could reschedule our appointment since our flight and times wouldn't allow us to make our original one. Each time they tried to find a new opening for us, and even a few hours before we went they scheduled us on a Sunday after I called. Nikki and Limmie were our therapists. They went above and beyond expectations for a massage!! They set the music to that that would fit my bf and I perfectly. They taught us (mistly my bf) all about tight and knotted fascia and stretching. Limmie went through a number of stretches and flexibility therapies on me. They had us laughing and having a good time the entire session, and we got educated without even realizing we were getting educated.

The standard dishes - chinese broccoli, xiu mai, ha cao, chicken feet, black bean pork ribs, steamed bbq pork bun, shrimp wrapped in thick rice noodle, chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle - were all a-ok.  The rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty; flavors were similar to Vietnamese 'com ga', with ginger, light soy, and chicken.  The xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard; rich and super flavorful.  All the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!).  The only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired; just the basics.

I started training with Bobby at Results Only right before my wedding and within 10 weeks of working out with Bobby I lost about 15 lbs and 1 dress size. My husband had similiar results. My arms never looked better...I was sincerely a beautiful bride...at age 43 I looked better at this wedding than my 1st one! 

When we first started looking at gyms we were struggling with how to fit in everything we were looking for in a gym...times of classes, co-ed so we both could attend, small enough for personalized attention, motivating enough to keep us coming back and fun...we hate working out, so if we were going to avoid going out for drinks and dinner we needed some SERIOUS motivation.

The group training is co-ed, the classes are offered at the perfect times for our schedule, the gym is near our home and the owner, Bobby, is crazy funny and terribly motivating - he keeps us going!

BUT....I really knew that Results Only fit our family and our lifestyle when Bobby introduced his TEEN fitness program to my son! Bobby was an instant hit with my Pre-Teen and now he is eagerly getting in shape and learning about fitness, gaining confidence and having fun at Results Only. We are hooked. I can't imagine where we would find a gym like this and I have tried quite a few gyms in the valley - and have great things to say about many of them - but Bobby has offered us the MOST for our family and delivered the highest level of results.

2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     12/100


I've heard about this park from family and friends over the years, but didn't experience it myself till sometime last year. After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week. 

I agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more. 

- A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood. 

- A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here. 

- There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike. 

   It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not. 

- There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.

- There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) ) 

- There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city. 

- At the top, there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city. 

- Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch. 

- There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months. 

- Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning. 

- Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well. 

*** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park.",5.0

Our server was polite but a bit...ditsy & didn't understand the questions we asked or reply with the correct response. I ordered their Alfredo- it smelled & looked terrible upon arrival but I forced myself to at least try it. Huge mistake! When I stabbed it with my fork it was one big massive clump that tasted like it was held together with elmers glue & watered down flour. Although it was luke warm @ best on the surface, it was cold underneath. Even the poor attempt @ garlic bread was laughable. Someone smeared butter on toast & sprinkled too much  garlic salt on it. It's pretty damn bad when Olive Garden's food is more tolerable than this inedible crap. 
 Our friend ordered their The Biggest Haja Steak Sandwich, this should've been called ""The Biggest Hard Turd Sandwich"" if they wanted to provide a more accurate description. When he bit into it, he literally could not tear one piece off because it was so tough & rubbery. He tried  sawing at it & the knife didn't even make a dent. When Mike stopped to ask us how everything was, Nate expressed how terrible the meat on the sandwich was @ Mike stood their as if he didn't comprehend a word that was said to him. In fact, he kept cutting Nate off & saying "" So it's okay"". Naturally, Nate was irritated & said "" NO! I can't eat this"" & Mike still didn't get it & kept talking over him. Then he walked away...he never apologized nor offered to get Nate something else to eat. He didn't remove the cost from our bill, nothing! When Nate complained to our server he didn't understand either so the nasty sandwich sat there. Our server also saw that my pasta was left untouched but never asked if something was wrong. I get this kid was clearly new to the food service industry but seriously -WTF!?!  
 My husband had also ordered a drink from the bar when we first sat down, it took our server over 15 minutes to grab it from the bar. Nate had requested a rootbeer, not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! Normally I wouldn't suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints, the food wasn't even edible & our patience was gone; I was tempted to leave without paying. 
 Finally, a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove Nates sandwich from our receipt. However, she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1.

But the whole process was so smooth. I booked it through Costco Car Rentals so the rental was bit less and I got a decent rate for insurance.
Reached at terminal-2 parked my personal vehicle and took the shuttle to the Car rentals place.Reached Budget at 9:30AM to pick up the vehicle, there was one guy in the queue.
The rental guy was very friendly and he offered me 3 flavors of the Jeep and he gave me the 2015 model. The vehicle was in excellent condition and make sure you don't mess up with the vehicle while returning.

4 Star because of few issues:
- they never picked up the call before I could get my Jeep.
- Before I got the Jeep, someone had put chocolates inside the cabinet and the Jeep manual was in lot of chocolate !!!! I wanted to know more about the 4W drive but looks like no one knew how to operate it. I googled it  out and found my answers. Yes one lady came and cleaned the chocolates before I got my Jeep.

R9LpeScmNjYx3YEj9X_eyA,"Let me start by saying I wish that I could give 1/2 stars. I would rate 3 1/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives. 

The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy. 

One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.

Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.

Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent.",3.0
3-Z-1Mh5YKsFgwEaYQTFcw,"I want this place to do well, because it would be great to have a fancy Mexican option in town. I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems.
The drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails.
One of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles. 
I am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn't that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry.
Another rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn't very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.

I think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.

Another weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.  I can't help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual Mexican people aren't ""classy"" enough to wait tables.",3.0

3jzsvc7iNpyppcPG0dMSrA,"I was staying across the street at the Wynn and my post-Disneyland Half Marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so I suggested we check out TI for dinner. I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, ""The Buffet"" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.

First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.

I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck",2.0

I asked the girl taking the orders about which was better, either the Panzarotti OR 1 of the sanwiches.  She answered sandwiches and suggested the Chicken.  Chicken was in a schnitzel format, flattened, breaded, & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!

Only 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial, cut in half in which I only ate half for dinner, all for $7.  Cheaper than On-A-Bun.  A slew of toppings (cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc.) were ALL included for an additional $1.  Not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things.

I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.  We did, and to be fair that is a great dessert.  However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly.",2.0

K9dhdor2H--49Dm3k8zorQ,"We were searching for a local Peruvian restaurant and found this place on Yelp. It was the midafternoon, so the atmosphere was subdued. Some may refer to this place as a ""hole in the wall,"" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away. During our visit, the green-colored décor included a large mural, blue-checkered floors, TVs, and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area.

Santi and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12.95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice, spices, lettuce, yam, red onions, and Peruvian corn. The tilapia was fresh, nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering. The spices were nicely embedded, and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce. The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too. At first I was concerned about the portion size, but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile. 

We then shared Pollo Saltado ($11.95) made with chunks of chicken sautéed with chopped tomatoes, french fries, red onions, cilantro, mignonette and soy sauce, and a side of steamed rice. The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken. The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish. The fries were tasty, fried to perfection, and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors. I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes. It met my expectations.

The Seco de Res ($13.95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce, green peas, and served with fried yucca, salsa criolla, and Peruano beans. The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices. It was nicely stewed, tender, but also had lots of dry spots. The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish. The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins. We both loved the Peruano beans. It was nicely cooked down, subtly sweet, and flavorful. 

We were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce. The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants. 

The flavors were far-reaching, but there were a number of limitations worth noting. First, unlike most Peruvian restaurants, Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal. Secondly, service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal. But, for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table, an act I find unusual, offensive, and disrespectful. Ironically, we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened.

The server did however, give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food. Given the nice gesture, I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt, but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience.

Interested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table. I would be interested in returning to try their Anticuchos, Ceviche de Mixto, Cau Cau, Aji de Gallina, and Chaufa de Camaron.",3.0

I come here about 3-4 times a week average (bc I have a drinking problem. haha) I just never check in bc I forget. So far, they usually have the stuff I need.. lots of wine, beer, vodka,  mixers... you name it. If they dont have something, just ask.

mEwzfMkEUMcDDBwVtGUuAg,"Got here around 1:45, waited in line for about 15, not bad.  Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.

I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)

So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:

There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???

The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.

If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.

Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.

soEISY6l7GwgOIMYT4PDCw,"We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.

This NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.

I love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.

Sonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.

We started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.

For the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.

My husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.

There were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.

We were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.

All in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!",5.0

sfmp62dsseN4Kpg_3Qmy_g,"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone.

It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.

I was the first person to walk in the door and ask about the dog and she said well we have to wait to see if anyone else would like to see the dog and so of course there was someone else. Mind you- this person shows up 20 minutes before they opened and I waited an hour and a half... and what happens? They do a raffle and she ends up getting the dog.

2MKuVzM2yj2muewRC_7v-g,"Since everyone in my family digs Tandoori Times, I've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and, honestly, I'm a little underwhelmed.  Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.  

Nothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.   

I was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. 

Servers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  

I do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  

The atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK.",3.0

We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.

We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.

After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.

We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.

For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. 

We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.

Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.

As a residential realtor, its very important that my clients have a great experince with their investment property, as I rely on them for repeat business (home sales).  Each and every one of my referred clients have been thrilled with the service they receive from Active Renter.  Their fees are typical for the industry, and their customer service is top-notch.  When my clients are ready to sell, Rich refers them back to me for the listing.  He also notifies me of any off-market deals so I can give my investors as opportunity to buy their next rental at a discount.

In addition to referring my investor clients to Active Renter, they also manage my personal rental on 15th Ave and Northern.  They do a phenomenal job. They found me a great tenant, who takes immaculate care of the property.  The home was built in the 1960s, so it has the typical problems you would expect with an older home.

I had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage). While the actual body work and paint was fine, everything else was a total disaster. One one of the cars, a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop. We didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night, so we got screwed right there.

The other car was supposed to be in for a week, and it ended up taking three. They ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it, and I only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans. After we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !), a big scratch was on the trunk lid. Some sort of white residue was all over the car, and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places. I should have sued them, but I was tired of the aggravation.

We chose a new sauce and one we had previously tried and liked. Then we went in search of cheese. Whole Foods usually has a great selection of cheeses. Well, we didn't find much. This may have been our fault, as we did not walk down every single aisle...just most of them.  We did see sliced cheeses, but not the gourmet ones we hoped to find. We chose a cashew spread that I tried at a friend's place, and got crackers as well. 

At the checkout, the cashier had a sign posted saying that she is highly allergic to coconuts, and to please let her know if what you bought has any derivative of coconuts. Well, of the two hot sauces, the rice crackers (in a box), and the cashew spread I felt good in saying 'no coconut here'. She scanned the container and proceeded to look at it from every angle, turning it over and over. She asked where the ingredients were listed. I hadn't looked, so I did not know. She then schooled me on the fact that I would be surprised at how many things contain coconut oil in them. We paid, and went to the car. I was curious, so I found the ingredients. Yep. Contained coconut oil. I left feeling like I lied to her by not telling her it contained this ingredient. Made me uncomfortable. If she is that allergic, maybe gloves would be an option for her. But now I know...I will look at all ingredients if I shop there again, or just not go through her line.",3.0

When we arrived I saw it was quite busy inside. Employees were very busy running around everywhere to help different customers. I was actually a little happy about this because I didn't want to be pressured by someone into buying a fancier keyboard than I needed. We were able to browse the selection, try different options, and decide on our own. After making our choice I tracked down an employee at the front desk (Tyler) who came and helped us right away. He asked if we need a power source, and I'm thankful he did, because that's something I didn't think about. He tracked down what we needed and checked us out. He asked if we wanted a warranty, and he was able to answer all my questions about it without pressuring me.

That said, some experiences stand out more than others. Recently moving to Las Vegas from Denver, I was nervous about finding a new stylist. I was loyal to my Aveda stylist in Denver for over 5 years and loved every cut, color, and experiment.
Today I took the plunge and scheduled a haircut as I desperately needed about a foot of hair chopped.
I met Jessica, and she immediately put me at ease. She listened to my stories of how my hair has changed over the course of a pregnancy, she understood my challenges as a busy mom, and she wisely offered advice on some face framing and bang maintenance.
She was funny, smart and personable.
And that's just the beginning of Jessica's amazing work.
After relieving me from about 4 pounds of hair, Jessica so beautifully framed my face and shaped my hair to a magnificent style.

Nice patio.

There is not one sign posted anywhere to this in the store or on the front window of the store.  The isles still have the WIC symbols on them.  The cashier said she could call the front manager and I told her what good was it going to do if they don't take WIC.  I left a full cart with her and told her I had to go elsewhere now. 
When I got home I called the corporate office and put in a complaint.  The person I spoke with had no knowledge of this but took my name and said he was going to look into the matter and advised me to call the manager at the store.

XW_k92GocXHdnMIo-Y-VCw,"Terrible and expensive experience both times. First one was a year ago, when I requested the parts fellow to order me a new muffler. He said it would be in, in about 3 days. 5 days later I called, and he forgot to order it. 10 days later, I called them again, and they still forgot to order it, despite me being in front of the counter. 
Second situation was on Nov. 4 th, 2017. My 1998 Rav 4 was not carrying a charge despite me purchasing a new battery, the evening before. On that cold and snowy day, my wife and I broke down on 130th Ave S.E. . I managed to get the vehicle as far as the Safeway Parking lot, where we were stranded. I called the Canadian tire across the street and spoke to the manager. He told me to bring it right in. Well, we called a tow truck and waited for 2 and a half hours. No biggy there as it was a busy day for them as one could imagine. We brought the vehicle in on a large flat bead truck. I asked the mechanic, where did he want it; and he said anywhere. Once we dropped it; I went inside and spoke to Ron about the problems. Ron was a super nice guy. Very friendly. I mentioned to him, that there was a loose + positive cable clamp that had to be tightened. I needed to have the alternator checked as the new battery died on us . ""After the repairs are completed Ron, could you please have them do a safety check on the vehicle please?"" Here came the upsell. "" Well, he said, we have 3 different types of safety checks. Then he felt a pressing need to tell me all about them and their respective prices. I cut him off short, and instructed him to provide me with the cheapest (100.00) safety check. 
Here in point form, were the blunders that were committed. 
1. Ron got my name wrong, my sex wrong, and all this with me standing in front of him and correcting him as he put an entirely different name on the key tag. I corrected him and even called back to ensure that the information on the work order was complete; but he didn't even bother to put down the much needed information. That's just plain unprofessional. 
2. I spoke to him about purchasing a new battery, just the night before, and that my + cable clamp was not tight. Despite this, he didn't bother to put any of this on the work order. 
3. Never informed me of the labor costs, part costs if it was a alternator and so forth
4.Never mentioned on the work order that the vehicle died while driving; but instead, said that it just stalled. 
5. The assistant manager "" Dennis"" called and left a message for me, that the Rav would not pass a safety test because that battery is not working, and a headlight bulb was out. (Well of course....why do you think it was there?) 
6. The assistant manager called me a second time at my residence later the next day; and informed me that my alternator would need replacing despite it being purchased new from one year previous. I asked him how much the alternator was and he gave me a rough cost. Then he said I would be charged. 1.2 ( which I guess was one hour and twenty minutes) for the labour. Fair enough I said, go ahead with the repair. At this point I figured;, it will be about 5 hundred dollars by the time they soak me for everything. 
7. Later that day I picked up the vehicle and it was way over and above at $683.00. When asked to explain the costs...they said they were too busy. 
8. When I arrived home, I looked at the invoice and noticed that they hadn't even taken the time to fill out the top of the safety check. Truth be known, they never probably checked a thing. No name, no policy number, no make model or year of the vehicle, no Vin number, no date...absolutely nothing!
9. Shop supplies was 35 dollars and some change. There are only two bolts that secure an alternator to it's bracket. Tell me where were there 35 worth there? 
10. The assistant manager couldn't provide me ( their customer) with the proper warrantee period for it, nor did he know how long safety checks are good for. 
** Now after all that, does this sound like a professional service to you? They should be ashamed for treating customer's this way. 
Needless to say; I won't be back for any service. They are reckless and unprofessional.",1.0

DwkEq1yx4kbb9xxVBd6iwA,"I have been going to Dental Care West, the west side clinic offered by A.T. Still University since April 2015. They came highly recommended.  

I have had my scheduled appointments change 3 times without my approval. I find out about the change when I show up for my originally schedule appointment. This is very bad customer service.

Otherwise, most of the residents are OK dentists. You have to have a new dentist every July, so I am up to my third 'regular"" dentist. To get my appointments when I needed them, I changed the resident & dentist. I found out that many of the residents and their coaching dentists don't read the files to know what is going on with my treatment before I come in. This bad practice. I also had a problem when the dentist did work he thought I needed without discussing it with me first but not owning up to it after I got angry. Frustrating.

I have to go back hopefully only 1 more time to fix the problem they created. Problem: I had root canals and crowns done and then they did the implant extraction. During the healing time, my prior crowned teeth shifted resulting in a large gap between my teeth and pain.  They do realize that this is a problem they caused and are not charging me but they keep putting off doing the work. So now I'm re-scheduled with a different resident/dentist so I can get my work done.

so my husband and i decided to try the Clicklist function of order online and pick up groceries curbside. we arrived at 7:01 pm and watched for well over 10 minutes through the glass at the associate that was manning the station took cell phone calls, cut paper with scissors, took a selfie and what not before my husband went into the store proper to ask about getting our order. well after a minute after returning to the car after talking to customer service we decided to film said associate. she took another call and what not and we have well over 4 minutes of footage of her doing nothing. at this point we hit the 20 minute mark of waiting and my husband went back into the store where he was met by the cs employee and the manager. they called the associate up and she admired she'd taken some calls and told us we should have called her to let her know we were there. the websites specifically states to stay in your car as they come out to you and no phone number or instructions to call are issued in the confirming email i received. the manager didn't even apologize for her employee or try to make amends just assured my husband our card hadn't been charged as of yet so we canceled the order. we went to the smiths on sahara and nellis our normal store which doesn't have the Clicklist feature. i told them what happened and they gave us the office number to the area and we will be calling them as well as submitting screen shots of my confirming email, my order confirmation number and the 4 plus minutes of video to their corporate email.

Kelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.

The service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.

Ravi is awesome. I used to pick up lunch here weekly then sadly moved jobs and I  wasn't around the corner any longer.  If your lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood - do not turn down the opportunity to stop in and grab a bite to eat. 

There are always daily specials and the menu is posted on the large blackboard as you walk in. There are only 4 or 5 types of wraps and they are all great !  

If you get here just before noon you beat the rush, even if you get caught in the line - it's well worth the wait.  Every single item on the menu is terrific !  

Today I brought a friend here for a quick lunch and we both had the combo of corn & crab soup and the lamb wrap !! ..........WOW was it fantastic !   The combo is a prefect lunch. 

The restaurant is small and seats about 16 at a very large communal table and there are about 4 additional tables in the back space, or if you prefer to sit facing the street, you could be lucky to grab a spot at the window.  

In the spring, summer and early fall the patio is open and it is a lovely space to have lunch.

dRQy3XkQLRSAgZ8nfmYqjQ,"I purchased a used safe on Craigslist.  Not just any safe mind you.  Oh no, I HAD to have the super high security 4000 lb bank safe ... especially at the dirt cheap price it was listed.

Let me say that again - FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS.  Two tons.  About the same as a Toyota Highlander.  5 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and about 35 inches deep.

I spent several days calling around to places to get it moved.  No one wanted to touch this thing.  Then I called The Safe Keeper.

Don (the owner) agreed to do it for $800.  More than I wanted to spend, because I'm a cheapskate.  I finally agreed since no one else would take the job.

I'M GLAD I DID!!

Don and 3 of his guys picked it up from a warehouse near the strip, moved it to my home in Centennial.  They used two pallet jacks, an assortment of wood blocks and chocks, and floor coverings.  Four turns and one 36 inch wide doorway later, they had it placed EXACTLY where I wanted it.  No scuffed walls.  No indentations in the linoleum.  No damage to persons or property whatsoever.  

Not a lot impresses me.  (See my other reviews.)  But these guys did.  Folks, the whole crew were professional safe movers who worked seamlessly together.

hc4xT4PnFvzE5QQNROLIgg,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.",3.0

Unfortunately my experience was disappointing.  The front desk attendant offered the person who came in about 10 minutes after me a cup of tea, but failed to offer me any tea until that point when he realized he had forgotten to ask me if I wanted tea as well.  As soon as he brought the tea to me my stylist was ready so I didn't get an opportunity to drink it.  I showed my stylist pictures of what I wanted and explained in detail what I did and did not want.  She said she could do it and proceeded to cut my hair without conversing with me at all the whole time.  As a disclaimer I have curly/wavy hair.  I asked for side swept bangs that blended into my layers. The stylist insisted on blowing my hair out straight when she was finished-including a full fringe of blunt cut bangs on my forehead.  When I got home and examined my hair I saw all the layers were uneven and there was no way to style the bangs except to pull them back with bobby pins.

I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!

I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.

I came home around 5:30 PM to find the door to my apartment completely wide open. Thankfully nothing was stolen or vandalized but this just goes to show you how inept this complex  and its managers are at running a safe and responsible business. I reported the incident to management and never received any kind of response. My unattended apartment was left wide open for 8+ hours and the management couldn't be bothered to even call or email me about the situation.

They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.

This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.

The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos. No, I'm not telling where that is or how I get there. :)",3.0

Any business should always keep a consistent accounting policy.  Gift certificates outstanding should be noted in the event of a sale and still honored if not disclosed with an expiration as this one was not.

MpKouPn5PzS5qjicoSg8Qw,"I came here because of the mac n cheese. And yes, it's definitely that good. But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.

The happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.

The cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.

yUEujunJKtPttGxyprYCDA,"I have used a few different property management companies and never had such a horrible experience as I did with Paramount. I was having an issue with a non-working hot water heater which required a work order. The work order was put in and assigned to a vendor but the vendor cancelled. It was the day off during the time they should have been at my home. I told the vendor that was unprofessional and unacceptable so I would be contacting my property management. I was not rude just direct. I am a manager in one of the largest corporations so I know all about tone and customer service. Before I could call Paramount they called me. She did not let me speak or explain the issue before she advised me that I was rude and had no right to speak to the vendor that way. I tried to tell her I was not rude and she was not on the phone with us so why would she listen to a vendor over her own tenant. She said because I was a liar and she believed them since she had worked with them before. She continued to speak to me like I was not a paying tenant and yell at me like I was causing the issue. I had to remind her it is Paramounts legal obligation to provide water and hot water since I am the tenant. She said she was going to cancel my work order since I was rude and had issues. I am sorry but no matter how rude (which I wasn't) it is the property managements responsibility to make sure this is fixed. This was 3 days now with no hot water. I tried to explain I had just gotten home from the hospital from major surgery but she disregarded any empathy and continued to yell at me over the phone. I advised her I would be letting the Better Business Bureau know and the local housing agency. In the end, my husband ended up calling and her tone was totally different. She made it sound like I was the one who was irrational and upset but of course my husband believed me not her. She was speaking nicely to him until he advised her that he was my husband and he did not appreciate how she spoke to me. She then reverted back to her old self and had an attitude. He advised her that this is not how things work and it is their legal obligation to make sure this gets taken care of in a timely manner. He also stated he was an Army veteran and he gave her respect so she needed to give him respect and return. She continued to be reckless with her words so he ended the call with stating he would report Paramount to everyone he could. A manager and supervisor were asked for multiple times and she stated she was the person to talk to. We found out later that she was neither and was just an administrative assistant apparently on some type of power trip. I would never recommend this property management company because they treat their tenants like trash and have no sense of what customer service really is.",1.0

My typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.

I love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.

I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas.

s3DktUmaIVGdGU9XDXX5qQ,"Note: This review is strictly based on the food at Fresh and not the juices and such.

First off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food). 

I had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu. 

The place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit / vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.

Anyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process.",2.0

Both times the food was too greasy for me to eat, and both times the people I have been with, also did not enjoy their food. This last time one of my friends had to send his food back because it was too salty (the ham) and too greasy (the toast). They were nice about it and did not charge him. 

BOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that ""this is how item x is made,"" - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble. 
Some perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried. 
It's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component. 
The hash browns are literally, round oil sponges. Disgusting. 
This is the oiliest brunch in town. Hands down. It's a shame because the space is so beautiful and open.

FhXgUQo8_rj-wO_i-JNJmw,"When one thinks of sushi in Northeast Ohio, a place on the border of Parma next to a Subway and a convenience store is not going to come to mind. Thankfully though, the check cashing place is no longer there. As a result I had driven past it many a time without a second thought. A few months ago I figured that I might as well give it a shot.

I'm glad I did, to put it lightly. The service has been attentive each time I have been there, and the decor is nice. What surprised me is that rarely have I seen anyone else eating there. Either I'm there at the wrong times or others have made the same assumption I did. I had miso soup a couple of times while they prepared the sushi, and it is just the right blend of ingredients. I'm a snob when it comes to miso so impressing me with that is a big deal.

As for the star, the sushi, it is made fresh with care and it shows. The $3 happy hour rolls are delicious, and the specialty rolls are even better. The Parma rolls in particular have become my all-time favorite, despite the fact that it is not so much sushi as it is crab on a ball of rice.

She is a very excellent cook herself and would tell the waiter if something was not to her liking. The salsa was perfect each time, with just the right amount of heat and spice, not overwhelmingly tomato-y or salty. In fact, I told the chef (who was leaving for the day) that I came from SF to have his salsa and he prepared a pound of FRESH chips and a pint of my favorite salsa to go, with a thank you note (he did this in less than 5 minutes).

I'm very impressed with The Sparklings.
I waited months and months for it to open and even asked ""when are you opening"" to a construction worker once :)

It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake. 

The ambiance of the former sushi joint 
is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.

The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food. 

We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits. 

They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.

Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)

The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol. 
The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.

I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.

I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.  

I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much.

I tried to order a Festool sander from them and it went down from there.  I was initially mislead being told that I could not pre-order a tool and that they would be getting in plenty in a month.  Little did I know that they were taking pre-orders on their 'other' web site.  It happened by luck that I found the link 3 1/2 weeks later and booked my order.  Sadly that placed me beyond the ""plenty"" that were getting shipped in November and because of the delay, I still have not got my order.  Not to say they didn't bill my credit card for a product that I have not got. (over 4 months now).

To make matters worse, their customer service is to the point of non existent.  I have tried on multiple occasions to try and get even a general date of when I will get my product that I ordered.  I keep getting told SOON.  

I found out through Festool Canada that they over booked and over sold what they were allocated.  Festool has told them fulfillement amounts and when product will be shipped out to them, but sadly Atlas will not pass that on to the customer.  I don't know where I stand in their queue for product so I am just left in the dark.  

The management is condescending if you try and talk with them.

iil8IsURyC70mvVyeUMvFQ,"When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:

1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.

About half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.

2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:

*One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words. 

*My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.

*My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.

*I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.

The staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control.",2.0

When I went to pay for my second appointment the girl tried to get me on the plan for paying for the birth. I had to decline her 4 times. I still received 2 letters in the mail for the plan of birth including pay by dates.

kTb7bROWOWLioKFx_DLaiw,"I was stationed in Nevada in 2012 and relied heavily on Verizon. Horrible mistake. No service in my dorm or anywhere on that block. I spent $500 on a brand new galaxy s4. After about a year, everything started deteriorating. GPS stopped working, service got worse, and miscellaneous files took up most of the space on my phone.

Verizon's fix? Spend $800 om a new phone. An A1C in the USAF makes about $17k their first year, so a new phone was out of the question. I replaced the antennas and restored service, but then It happened again; this time replacing things didn't work. I haven't been able to use my GPS in 4 years. I can't put anymore files/pics/songs on my phone because I have 20 GBs in random files that can't be erased.

The service is unbearable. I went to San Diego with my girlfriend to visit her family. I had a phone interview because I was a few weeks from separating from the mil. There wasn't any service anywhere. I drove around for 45 mins looking for service. Found it, but something malfunctioned and instead of the call going through as I stared at my phone, a voice mail popped up. I tried calling back, but all the bars dropped to zero. This was a nightmare. Ultimately, I didn't get the job, presumably because I hadn't prepared myself for the interview with better service.

It's gotten to the point where I stay at home all the time incase a company calls about a job. It's the only place in las vegas thag I get signal. I don't even get service in the Verizon store.

Their fix? Get a ne phone. Create a problem. Sell a solution. How come my laptop doesn't malfunction because of its age? I use it more than my phone because it's more reliable. The UAVs we flew had data link systems that rarely, if ever, had to be changed.

I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we both ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich had good flavours, however the server suggested that we change the slaw if we don't like horseradish. Really glad that I did because it seemed to make more sense with the slaw that we substituted. We ordered a side of fries as it is not included with the sandwich, and were presented with a hefty bowl of tasty shoestring fries which neither of us could finish.

However, the chicken was really dry. And when I say dry, I mean you need to soak your mouth with water to get some flavour and juice out of it. I always thought that rotisserie chicken was meant to be juicy, but this chicken seriously lacked the juice that you would normally expect. 

I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, it's situated in a great neighbourhood, trendy indoors and nice patio that offer a warm welcome with very friendly service. In fact, I would say the service is the only reason that I'm giving it three stars.

aL5qBrTc6fVo8qil_Rb2ng,"I could write a review entirely refuting the poor reviews that HuHot has received on Yelp thus far. Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience. 

To start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win. 

As part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty. 

We ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us. 

A unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas. 

Mind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot. 

Besides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.

Oh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for?

Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant.

QuagK5tnnjiKxN0cNdvnOA,"We have a friendly little rabbit that we needed taken care of while we went on an 8-day vacation. There were a few options similar to Springbank Pet Resort, but I am glad we chose this place!

We dropped her off in the morning before our flight. They took us to the ""bunny and small animals room"" where we were allowed to set up her playpen, litterbox, and toys just the way we have it at home. The woman taking care of the small animals was extremely friendly and I felt good about leaving our bunny in her hands. We provided feeding instructions and they put labels on everything so our bag of food and hay wouldn't get mixed with someone else's. 

We picked up our rabbit and she was ready to go for us, in great shape and seemed to be friendlier than when we dropped her off! They did a wonderful job and we will use this place again!

Pros: 
-Rabbits are only $12/day (such a deal for piece of mind)
-Friendly staff 
-Rabbits are kept in their own room away from barking dogs (lower stress).
-Rabbit was in a good mood upon pickup and litterbox was cleaned for us.
-Vet clinic next door (you can sign a waiver in case of medical emergency)

Cons:
-The only con about this place was that the room where the small animals were being kept was not as clean as I think it should have been. When we set up our rabbit, the floors hadn't been mopped in a while and there were rabbit poops on the floor that I had to sweep myself.",4.0

I'm from California and was in Vegas for the weekend with my family, needless to say trip was less than a celebration. Friday night when arriving to our hotel thankfully that's were car gave out. It overheated and just died in the middle of parking lot stopping traffic as it was in the way to parking structure. AAA very quickly arrived  as I explained the situation, towed my car to a parking space. Advice to have it towed to a mechanic first thing in the morning to get it checked; he provided two shops info to contact them in the morning as he knew lots of shops weren't open on the weekends. As soon as I woke up Saturday at 7am, I started calling the shops with no luck since they weren't opening till 8am, finally I got a hold of the closest shop to my hotel and they sadly told me they weren't able to assist me until sometime next week that wasn't doable or an option for me since I only had reservations till Sunday and had to get home by Sunday. So I went down the list of approved AAA shops and got a hold of Imperial Auto & Truck Service and I can't recalled who answered the phone but he was very polite and pleasant and did tell me that I could bring in the car but couldn't guarantee to have it fix today. I walked in the shop like a lost puppy not knowing where to go but as soon as I approach the front desk here came Ariel (my angel) she was so nice and could see my desperation in my face to the point where I broke down crying feeling helpless, she came around and hugged me offering me comfort. She got up to talk to the owner Loren who then came and introduced himself and same as Ariel tried to comfort me introducing me to the whole staff; he said they were gonna take a look at my car and keep me posted. Ariel and Drew the other owner of the shop both kept me updated on the progress of my car. I felt like a fool, I couldn't stop crying, but they all made me feel better even offered me tacos as it was their lunch time and stayed opened past their business hours to make sure I was gonna be driving home Sunday! And I did! Talk about customer service! I can honesty say they are all one happy Family like Drew one of the owners told me that day trying to comfort me.. you guys saved my disaster of birthday weekend, thanks to you guys I was able to enjoy the rest of my weekend with my son and my mom!

I'm sure if our party had gone earlier, we would have been able to get the bigger, more meaty ones but oh well.  For a first timer, the buffet would be good but coming back to eat again would be really difficult to justify the $40+ price tag.  Even on a comp, I would probably prefer to have an enjoyable more peaceful meal at the CAFE!",3.0

Q_1_FmQdH6PoFygqcGjsxA,"I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm more of a meat-etarian... But I would recommend this place to those who like to dine vegetarian..

Mom told me a few of her friends recommended this place, so I guess she wanted to go..

Made a RSVP for Friday night, parking was full and place was packed, so we waited 15 minutes.

Sat down and ordered a few dishes which we accustomed to and also ordered some unfamiliar dishes recommend by Yelp users.

Overall the food was very good. Although I'm not into this type of food, I could tell it was pretty well cooked, props to the kitchen!! 

Only complaint is the food came pretty slow considering we came later in the evening and by the time we got seated, the place was half empty..

I personally wouldn't come back here for dinner unless if someone wanted to go or if I had to accommodate vegetarian friends - just because I prefer meat and seafood.. 

But I would come back to try their dim sum dishes, as they look delicious and I have faith in the kitchen.

yHKMBHOo4VwPhVKO42Ub2A,"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. 
I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone.",2.0

The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious.

The real issue here on two specific occasions is this; I was attracted by all the ads and photos of their somewhat new Temari offering. It stands for ""hand ball"" or the like and are rice balls either stuffed, mixed or topped with various ingredient combinations. 

In sum it adds up to this; too expensive for the lack of quality ingredients in the 4 balls themselves. The photos are quite misleading and in the case of the crispy lobster balls is virtually faux...where's the beef comes to mind...pretty much lobster rillettes at best.

We arrived about 10:30 and they checked our bags so we could go to the pool and then called when our room was ready. Friends had raved about the pool @ Mandalay and they were right. The wave pool and lazy river combo kept our daughter entertained for hours. We ate/drank everyplace by the pool and what we really liked is not only the friendliness of the staff, but how we didn't feel milked for every last penny. Food, drink, lattes and pastries in the morning and dinner at House of Blues were all very reasonable and help to guarantee that we'll be taking the trip back more often.

aENDbtsUlxlR84H0zXOnBQ,"Looking for a place to drink and chit-chat in downtown after work. Bar Hop Brewco might be another good choice for you. They offer 36 in-house brewed beers and almost 100 bottle beers. Their yummy snack are only $5-$9. This Bar Hop Location is their 2nd location located on Peter street. Luckily, they have a roof-top patio.  So it will be perfect for a sunny day.  However, we came here when it was still cold  and they haven't opened their patio yet.

It was our first time for this location.  We came late night on Sunday few weeks ago.  It was around 11 pm and it was packed!  No one seemed to want to leave the place early .  We waited for 15-20 mins before we got a chance to sit at a barrel table.  We actually had a barrel table when we got in.  A waiter suggested us to wait at the barrel table close to their bar but two guys who came in after us just walked there and sat right away when they saw it.  Ya..they saw us too but who cares right? They were pretty drunk before they even got in there.  I didn't want to argue with them because I dint think they could understand anything at that time .  So we just stood there and waited for another barrel table.  We ordered beers to start with and waited for almost another half an hour for a real table  that we could sit and eat.  I'm a big eater! 

Food
 Appetizer
 - My luv  ""Pan Seared Mushrooms""  It was delicious!  They were roasted with garlic and glazed with  porter  It was a generous portion with a $5 price.  If you love mushroom, you would love it! 
 - Pork Cracklings   One word ""Huge!""  And only $5.
 - BBQ Tertilla Chips $5 was worth money for its portion.  It was also good with beers.

 Main
 - Fried Chicken Sandwich $15.  It was fine for us but nothing was special.  We'd prefer big puffy butter fried chicken sandwich 

Atmosphere 
 - Atmosphere was great and clean. The main floor was decorated with wood and beer barrels.  It was cozy but they have limited seats if they don't open their patio.

Service
 -  Understand that its hard to expect a good service in bars.  However, Bar Hop always has a good name on its good service at the original location on King street.  So they catch up on that for this location too.  I saw two waiters running around the bar.  I wasn't sure if they short of staff!?  I hope they have more staff next time we come by.

You have to stand there while they cook it but for some reason this seems faster than sitting at your table.  They have a wider variety of food and meat than Flat Top also and because they have the two sides of the buffet open with the same choices, you don't feel as rushed with people crowding you.

j1ltOqkUDwgfNuapeCAXIA,"I have to start this by saying my first trip to Doan's was 3.5/4 star material - slow service but friendly, I enjoyed a delicious veg/tofu pho (in a beef broth) and my dining companion ordered a bun with nicely flavored meats and a pretty good spring roll on top - but my second visit made me wonder.

I was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.

I ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik/pork/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu/veg and the tofu/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue. 

Everything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service.

It had been processed 2 times in one week, the 2nd time was an attempt to fix the 1st try, and it looked horrible!  I refused to go back to the other salon and searched for someone well reviewed with good knowledge about color.  I found Jessica and was not disappointed.  

I showed her photos of what I wanted originally, told her at this point I just wanted to be comfortable walking out of the house.  Part of my hair was almost blonde, part was almost black, so to give me highlights and even color throughout was going to be hard.  I thought I would need blonde highlights throughout, but she said she could get it closer to the look in the photos.  

We went over colors, she gave suggestions and input based on my skin tone. - From that moment on, I felt comfortable.  She was really taking her time. - Asking lots of questions, discussing what would look best and what would be less harsh on my hair.
She foiled me up, gave me a conditioning treatment, added a little more color, then cut, dried and styled.  She was very friendly and attentive through the whole process.  
I'm so happy, and VERY impressed.  I truly love the color and cut!!

Whether you need a ceramic ginger grater, a battery-powered pepper mill, or just a new knife, it's probably hiding somewhere in amongst the jumbles of kitchen implements here.

It's lots of fun to browse, but if you're in a hurry, it's best to ask one of the staff to help you find whatever you're looking for--otherwise, you could easily waste a half hour. Luckily, most of the employees seem fairly knowledgable about what's in stock and which fondue pot it's hiding behind. Compared to the Williams Sonoma over at La Place in Beachwood, Sur La Table has a better selection, better prices, and better staff.

Although this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end. 

The best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect. 

For my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would.

bVPTxKhjj4qyTF7_43nY-g,"Ikea is not just a store, as my fellow Yelper indicated. It is a phenomenon.

Much has been written here and elsewhere about this international mega-chain which specializes in moderately-priced, well-designed contemporary modular (i.e.,assemble-it-yourself) furniture and home accessories. Ikea is exactly what it purports to be, so there is not much I can add to its description. 

As I write this post, 28 February 2009, I am having a hard time believing my first experience at the Charlotte location of this Scandinavian retail giant.  It opened only ten days ago, and apparently the circus-attraction atmosphere hasn't worn off yet. Picture this: today was wet, windy, and  foggy. It rained incessantly. Yet, when we approached the Ikea ""campus"" via North Tryon Street, there were blockaded traffic lanes, a half dozen patrol cars, and not less than a mile of bumper-to-bumper traffic waiting to get into the parking lot. Incredible. It was as if the economic crisis never happened. I was amazed.

The giant store apparently has only one main entrance and exit, much like its big box cousins. That was particularly inconvenient on a day like today, where staying dry was a challenge. Once inside guests were funneled upstairs via escalator to begin their march around the massive showroom. Everyone was encouraged to grab a courtesy tape measure, pencil, and store map on which to make those all-important pre-purchase notations. 

The displays were massive, impressive, and incessant. I thought the furnished recreations of a living space that indicated its square footage an especially effective way to illustrate how Ikea furnishings, heavily oriented toward efficiency, work well in small, tight spaces. I had to chuckle ironically however, since many of the living spaces I've seen since moving to Charlotte are anything but small or tight, quite the contrary. But given the current economy, maybe more folks will be downsizing (I'm thinking of multiple-family McMansions with kids using closets as bedrooms- hee hee). At any rate, Ikea certainly knows how to present its information clearly and effectively, and I'm sure they'd gladly do McMansions as well as small urban spaces.

My biggest beef with Ikea, however, is purely personal. For one thing, any store with arrows on the floor indicating the direction I should walk gives me the creeps, regardless of the crowd size. I don't enjoy being herded into a space and then being compelled to move through it in any direction except the one I choose. Second, I am just not a big fan of the whole box store shopping experience, where the sheer space and quantity of stuff outweighs my eye's ability to focus on detail. I feel certain, judging by the size of the crowd, that my opinion represents the minority, but that's just me. 

I will give Ikea props in the kitchen and bath design department, where the concept of modularity and space-consciousness works well. It also appears the Ikea staff are well-trained and prepared to help customers with both the design and planning in those areas. 

I am sure I will return to Ikea, if for no other reason than I'd like to spend more time trying to focus on the design aspect of its furnishings and accessories. But until the massive crowds and homeland security-like police presence calm down, I will continue to delay my next Ikea shopping experience. Today's tightly-controlled visit reminded me more of a trip to the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport than, say, my last outdoor concert where I saw Radiohead. I will follow the direction of the crowd-police for Radiohead, but not for kitchen cabinets. Not yet, anyway.",3.0

SUMMARY
Cheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store. 

PROS:
- Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful. 
- Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays. 
- Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef.
- Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.

CONS: 
- They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening. 
- They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store. 
- The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty.",4.0

Pizyh5YMEUtYJ9hMAP2Mbw,"This is going to be long...I'm sooo satisfied with the customer service my boyfriend and I received from Jesus! Our stroller was bought as a gift online for $560. Now it was online for $399 so I called the Target.com phone number since the stroller was purchased online and asked for a price adjustment. They said I would have to put my stroller back in the box, return it in store or mail it back, & repurchase online to get the credit & they would ship me another stroller. Kind of a hassle but I thought $160+ was worth it. So when I got off work, I look up the stroller online to make sure it's still available and it is NOWHERE to be found on the Target website. I call the online number, spoke to 2 different people and both said I could purchase through the phone at the price I saw online, $399. So I box the stroller back up, drive to my nearest Target, explain to Jesus & what does he do? Dismiss everything I explained, he asks me to login to my registry, scans the stroller box & says, ""Whoa! That's a lot of money!"" Refunds to a gift card $611.48, scans it again, tells me it's now $279.96. I was like, ""okay!"" Obviously I wasn't going to argue with that price when I was originally going for the ""$399.99"" price. Lol He hands me my gift card and tells me, you have a credit of $308.84 left on the gift card. I thank him and we walk out with our stroller. Definitely a big score! I had been dreading the inconvenience of having to wait to get my other stroller in the mail. So walking out with my same stroller was awesome. I went home and set it up again & I also ended up purchasing our baby monitor and glider from the Target website with the credit we received. I could not be happier. :)

About 3 days later, I walked in to return a baby bath tub for store credit. I received 5 for my baby shower so I was looking to see where some had been purchased since I hadn't gotten gift receipts. Once again, Jesus helped me out. Super friendly, super fast, no hassles!

Zr0tumZG1Na8E7_v8YipTg,"I need to begin this review by stating: I hate Brussel sprouts.  As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.  

As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.

When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!

How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!

Outstanding, However that was the only part of the dish that was going to be eaten by my son.  This dish should be changed to just Biscuits and Gravy!  

Let me make a note that if it was not for the hostess and the guy bringing by the coffee I would have given breakfast 0 stars. However I am giving breakfast 2 stars for the things that were good.  

Also if you read the reviews it is obvious that Guy and his staff have written this place off as a lost cause because I cannot even see where they have replied to any of the reviews they have received.  Good or Bad.

Experience #2. 2 Stars.

Over all we give Guys a very charitable 3 stars.

sOZ_f0suc5E81uLIiMHuJw,"This is a home reno supply store, similar to a Home Depot in the middle of Little Portugal. But unlike Home Depot's gaudy orange and grey monstrosities of warehouses, this supply store is jam packed with aisles brimming with essentials. Walking around, it's like you're in a maze with more cool stuff waiting around the next corner. They have sections devoted to different aspects of building things with staff on hand to answer questions. The check out counter is well staffed and right by the entrance making it easy to park right in front on Ossington, jump in the store and quickly dash away. What is super impressive is their bathroom piece selection. Upstairs they have a showroom with modern freestanding bathtubs and fancy showerheads and kitchen sinks lined up showcasing beautiful design. If anyone knows ceramic tile, the Portuguese know it better than anyone. The selection is fantastic! The mecca in the GTA is Olympic tile, but after going thru Olympic, Downtown Lumber won out with its tight selection of choice tile designs and helpful staff. There is even free customer parking right behind the store where a tight laneway leads you to almost valet style parking, very nice! When your order for lumber, cement, or tile is filled at the service counter in the store, you take the invoice down the back laneway where the warehouse is tucked away. After a couple visits I was most impressed how the guy back there immediately came out to fill my order after driving into the tight spot. And he even loaded up the heavy tile into the car (they also deliver!). Super service from some incredible and dedicated people. Thumbs up Downtown Lumber!",5.0

I arrived early but was greeted and offered refreshment immediately. Really loved the vehicle and started negotiating. Basically told them what I wanted and could do and they met me exactly there without any issue. They also gave me more for my trade in than anyone else had offered. It took a long time to get with the finance manager and that part was the only real detractor from the experience. 

I did notice the typical extra items they could have tried to tack on and it sounds like from other reviews they sometimes try to add that stuff on, but if you give them the bottom line and have confidence knowing what you need in your vehicle, probably won't be a problem.

They say they have 24 hour maintenance and they will not show up outside of regular working hours. They have an answering service that takes a message and they don't get back to you the next day. You still have to call again. They came into my house rearranged things to get to a valve and did not put anything they moved back. When I asked if they were going to, they rudely rolled their eyes and said, ""probably not."" The women in the office are rude overall. They are rude when I ask for my packages, as though it's such a pain for them to get up and get them. They are stuck up and fake. The pool is so cold I can't stand being in it for one second. No one picks up their dog feces. They never have bags for people to pick up their dog feces because one person steals them all for themselves and the lazy ass office bitches refuse to fill it up even though one of them works every day. You hear random dogs barking all day. It NEVER stops. You hear dogs barking from the ghetto behind the building too. People from the neighborhood break-in and use the pool and work out room. It is such a high crime area, there is no way to safely take a walk without being mugged. The work out room is so small that it's hard to get a machine because of the people from the hood next door using the facilities. There is no where to recycle and you can bet I got a rude answer when I asked if there was one. There is no outgoing mailbox. You can leave your mail on a table in the office and hope no one steals it. However, that entails looking at the 3 wise bitches in the office. The maintenance man is nice, but obviously overworked from the crappy buildings he has to service. He looks suicidal every time I see him. A fire broke out and burned 3 apartments because of faulty wiring (which means any of ours could go next). Just when you think your silence about all of the issues going on here has paid off, they increased rent over $100 to renew my neighbors lease. Then they tell him that he has to give them 2 months notice when he was paying month to month. I do not want to get into the poor construction. It has the usual thin walls and difficult to clean surfaces. You can hear everything from your neighbors having sex to the bass from their music. There is no parking at all.

-rpyY-kxaz52ygEJoXjZrA,"I saw the Titanic Exhibit here on a Saturday morning. It was a fantastic experience which I highly recommend for everyone. But as we walked through it, and especially as I saw all the wide-eyed kids captivated by what they were seeing, it saddened me that a huge number of Phoenician families simply can't afford the tickets. $20 for adults, $15 for kids as young as 3. Do they really need to charge 15 bucks for a 3 or 4 year old to see this with parents? Come on. The exhibit took us about 90 minutes to complete. I'm docking two stars just because of the price, which is shameful for a so-called nonprofit to be charging the public. 

Price aside, the exhibit is wonderful. It's in Phoenix until May 4, 2008. To avoid standing in line, I recommend buying tickets on-line as we did, though there is a fee for that. 

You start off by being handed a somewhat cheesy ""ticket"" of one actual passenger who traveled on the Titanic, with some basic information about him or her. The exhibit wants to put you in the actual shoes of that person as you walk through, which I thought was effective. Only at the end of the exhibit do you find out whether your passenger survived the sinking or not. 

I chuckled at the passenger I was assigned to, who was a prominent Frenchman traveling to Montreal, Quebec for the purpose of designing a bust of the then Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfred Laurier. Of course I felt a personal connection to Monsieur Chevre, as a former Canadian Prime Minister and Montrealer myself. My companion was assigned a 21-year old Englishwoman who had bought a 2nd class ticket, and was traveling with family to New York for her wedding to an American. 

The exhibit is designed to be a comprehensive lesson on the Titanic. It sheds light on how artifacts were discovered and retrieved from the ocean, the design and building of the ship, what the interior rooms looked like for 1st class and 3rd class passengers, lifestyle and daily routines on the deck, and finally the collision with an iceberg and sinking of the ship. Over 1500 dead, out of over 2000. 

Hundreds of artifacts are on display, from personal items, to fine cutlery, to a door taken from the ship. The one that struck me the most was an old uniform top that still had its owner's faded name, ""Broom"", on it. Mr Broom was a first class steward who perished with the ship. All of the artifacts bring to life a snapshot of the world as it was in April of 1912. Even if you're not interested in the Titanic itself (and I am not), anyone who enjoys history would enjoy this. 

There was a guy dressed up as a passenger there who, to my amazement, either had an incredibly impressive fake Irish accent (and I fancy myself as pretty good at detecting fake accents), or he was actually an Irishman. I decided not to ask him directly because answering me would require him to step out of character. He was somewhat knowledgeable about the ship, as I found out by asking him about the decision to have only 20 lifeboats instead of the 32 that could have saved every passenger on board. The cut was essentially made for the sake of having a nice view from the deck. Nice work, ship designers. 

I will say that the analytical lawyer side of me was slightly disappointed by not seeing much that focused on the factors that caused the ship to hit an iceberg and sink. There are exhibits telling the basic story, but I was left wanting just a bit more. Still, by the time we reached the end and excitedly looked up our Frenchman and Englishwoman on the manifest to see if they lived or died, we were delighted to have finally seen this exhibit. We cracked up as we saw one 8 year old girl ironically complain to her mommy that ""her"" passenger died even though he was ""really really rich"".

ZBV6JTBUgucsH1_lfqIB5w,"POP was just what I needed on the first 3 digit day in Vegas yesterday! Situated in the corner of a large strip mall on Fort Apache, I was across the street for a lash appointment and decided to make a pit stop at Hobby Lobby. Felt parched and walked into Pop thinking it was a bubble tea joint, nope definitely not that - as the name implies it's pop for my midwesterners. Not just any old pop, speciality drinks made with pop. 

Such a simple concept honestly, but very well thought out and executed. I'm not much of a pop drinker, after all I counsel against it. But every once in a while I'll give myself the option, luckily it's not something I crave. Initially it was the feeling that I had walked into the place assuming it was something else but felt odd walking out. I got to looking at the menu and looking back outside at the sun beaming down and thought I'd give it a whirl. Have to say, I will be back!

Soda is used as a base ingredient to craft a drink. So if you create your own you choose a size, pick your soda (or tea for my healthies), pick your add ins. I appreciate that they have an XS size which for me was truly a S. Great for portion control people! Then they have a menu with fool proof recipes created for us. I chose the Jojo because I enjoy Dr. Pepper and substituted the coconut cream for vanilla cream. Yum! They also have a secret menu (see picture - white) of drink creations and needless to say I was overwhelmed with options. Finally, they have a foods fo pair alongside your beverages, popcorn and cookies. A kids menu per say - an XXS drink (12 oz) with kid size popcorn. Also, got beverages, coffee/hot chocolate. 

Aside from my beverage being delicious, I appreciated the service. It's a very simple concept so to speak, so the fact that the employee took his time to talk me through the menu was above and beyond. The pricing was right! The shop has ample seating, parking. You get a stamp card for return visits. I wasn't told explicitly about a guarantee but I'm sure my drink would've been remade had I not liked it.

My boyfriend loved his kabob, and I tried it and it was pretty good. The rice was kind of greasy and there was not much taste. The only thing that made the food different from other middle-east style eateries was the salad dressing which my boyfriend thought tasted like Big Mac sauce, and this other sauce for the meat that he said tasted kind of like salsa (not that it was bad, just saying).

6or-6g_8n7HlTQ6ZWE8zrw,"First off, Green Valley Ranch Resort is a hidden gem in the suburbs of Vegas. I am told its part of the 'Station' family. 

Dinner. We had an awesome wine recommendation, so perhaps the vino impacted my rating!  They brought out a seafood platter that could have fed an army: oysters, lobster tail, shrimp...unbelievable. 

Most of the table ordered steaks, and raved. I was just not in the mood, so I ordered french onion soup and buttermilk fried chicken breast. I never order fried chicken...but the server was correct that it was a hidden jewel on the menu. Moist, and Southern comfort food at its best. 

Expect a large bill, but its Vegas, which means no more inexpensive meals.

Kmu7D_u25Zz_3wFcbzO_nQ,"Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner. I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.

The bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.

The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.

The crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don't see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.

We stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category.",1.0
bt-YOeBNBfm2M79wGpuaSg,"I was quite surprised by my visit to Adega.
We had a reservation for 8:15 but showed up around 7:30 and they told us our table was waiting for us. Their tables are quite distant from each other, so you can actually listen to what your friends are saying 5 stars so far!
After we made our order we got bread and olives, which is typical for Portuguese restaurants I guess. I don't go to too many, so I'm not an expert. Bread was okay, but kind of generic. 3 stars for that
Food was another matter. We ordered the appetizer platter and some shrimp on the side. Everything was really good, and tasty. Their portions aren't even small, cause I felt  I was getting full by the time we finished the appetizers.
For main dish we all tried something different - seafood and meat. If you go there go for the seafood! My duck breast was tasty, but the portion felt small. My meal was the smallest of all. I didn't leave hungry so it didn't bother me.
Overall, I'd say food is really delicious, but not so imaginative. I felt like you can have some of the dishes at other places. 4* here
Desert: I ordered the creme caramel and everyone tried it. Everyone got wowed by it! I haven't tried creme caramel in a long time, but it was definitely what you should order if you ever visit 5* on that
Service: attentive and polite. Not much else to say. I have no remarks! The waiter was a really nice guy. This could be considered both good and bad, but I felt we had to wait too long to get our main dishes. I didn't care cause we were already having a good time, but for someone who's in a hurry it might be a problem 4.5 stars on service

Tried the Portuguese beer which was nice, but expensive. 

To sum it up, while the place might not be exactly 5 stars if I have to be more objective. My score reflects my overall experience from dining in there.

Would I go back again? On a good occasion for sure.
This place should also be perfect for a more quiet and romantic dinner!",5.0

r2mTPBeCs5noVOvh41QazA,"Britney is one of the few stars that has ever existed that can command an entire arena, that emits spiritual and psychic positive energy through her voice and performance that has the power to change how an audience feels.  I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.

I did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the ""oops"" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can't think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.

I am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he'd performed and had a fine time touring Elvis' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I'd experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! 

Shame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world's ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul's purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over.

VncR4VqbwldiJ7PKaSkKzQ,"Went to the White Brick Kitchen three times in the past 2 months. Twice for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place! 

We had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters! 

The second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people. 

Overall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though. 

The brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!

The food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay.

That was two months ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about that mouth slathering, soul-filling pulled pork, guacamole and tortilla sandwich.

I've been a bit of a boring adult these days; meal planning, watching my language, posting mommy-blog-esque quips on facebook, staying off yelp because I had nothing new or exciting to review... So when I found out that FG's was going to be at the Wychwood Barns beer market I dropped that ladle for the chicken soup I was making for my sick husband like a hot potato, ran across the street and then straight back home to enjoy my two sammiches.

The pulled turkey with purple slaw and bacon jam was tender; sweet but also savoury in all the right places.  

The beef short-rib and homemade kimchi made me break out in a post-coital sweat and I assured my husband that, yes, it is THAT good, while I tried to speak between bated breath.

That was lunch.  I just enjoyed the second halves of each sandwich for dinner.

My next appointment was for blonding. I have been trying to get a hairdresser to do this for three years!!! I could never convince anyone that I'd rather be blond with dark roots than brunette with grey roots. My hair is 50% grey and now I can finally work with it rather than fight it!

Initially,  I was a fan of Allegiant.   Early on , my extended family used it to get to Vegas from the Midwest.

We came here the other night because I had a craving for crab legs. I had the 1lb snow crab legs but instead of having the corn and red potatoes that come with the dish, I opted for the roasted mixed vegetables and a garden salad. My husband selected from a four-course special they were offering and chose cheese and broccoli soup, a caesar salad, shrimp and scallop linguine and the caramel cheesecake for dessert.

Everything I've ever had at this restaurant has been delicious and tonight was no exception. The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable albeit quite a bit more dimly lit than it used to be... you can still see your food, just not the person you're dining with (I kid!) and although the restaurant was relatively full, it was surprisingly quiet.

wJchWlQhqmcPjnPf-WccUQ,"I had waited a couple of months before making my first reservation at Lardon and I'm glad I did.  At 6:00PM on a Saturday night, we arrived promptly at the newly renovated restaurant and was greeted by their hostess, Doris, who was warm and friendly.  My party of seven took the remaining reserved table available in this cozy, dimly-lit restaurant.  The decor was simple yet relaxingly sophisticated.  The main entrance was lined by large open windows and the kitchen, situated at the opposite end of the restaurant, offered a glimpse into the brainchild of this joint.  At the pass, stood chef/owner Jacky Lo, ready to command his troops with military precision.

Four members at my table were actually back on their 2nd/3rd visit and I was advised that everything on the menu was to be desired.  Our server was knowledgeable and helped us navigate through the plethora of Italian jargon and we all agreed to order to share.  We settled on the following from their new menu:

Cornish Hen x 2
Steak Frites
Duck Confit
Parmigiano Reggiano
Rainbow Trout

Almost immediately after placing our order, we were surprised by some bread paired with a side trio of sun dried tomatoes, olives, and anchovies.  The table was torn as to which of the three complemented the toasted bread but we managed to clear the plates within minutes.  Personally, I enjoyed the anchovies the most as their saltiness just hit the spot.  Not normally an olive lover, I found the olives to be fruity and fragrant.

As the main course came out, the first thing I noticed was the clean presentation.  As for each dish:

Steak Frites - Done sous-vide style, I had never experienced a piece of beef that was done so perfectly a medium rare (as recommended by our server).  This is in agreement with Meagen B.'s review.  The only complaint that I had was that I was required to share this dish with 6 other people but that's of no fault to the restaurant.  Interestingly, the frites were actually my favourite part of this dish as the potatoes were thickly cut, crunchy on the outside, and soft and buttery on the inside!  Mmm, yum.

Cornish Hen - The hen arrived already de-boned with a crispy, golden brown skin and sitting on a bed of beluga lentil and carrots.  A bite into the hen revealed a hint of sweet alcohol which we later discovered was from the shiaoxing wine marinade.  Not necessarily my favourite dish but others seemed to really like it.

Duck Confit - Normally confined to dried pasta from a box, Lardon's fresh pasta was a first for me.  The duck was succulent but what sealed the deal for me was the sweet pieces of pear that accented the dish.  Nice!

Rainbow Trout - This was probably the star of the entrees and really the best bang for your buck.  The trout had an amazing smoky flavour that was infused deep within the fish, underneath the crispy skin.  I highly recommend this dish especially if you enjoy quinoa!

Unfortunately, I was sitting at the other end of the Parm-Reg so I can't comment on it.  Though, it looked on par with all of the other dishes.

Though full, the entire table shared one of each choice from the dessert menu which included:

Creme Brule - Thick custardy texture, maximum vanilla bean flavour, topped with a crackling sugar crust.  The best I've ever had.

Mango-Lemon Grass Sorbet & Berry-Basil Sorbet - The mango sorbet tasted like a perfectly ripe mango while revealing hints of earthy lemon-gress while the berry-basil was just to die for!  Top it all off with a fresh biscotti cookie.  Perfect.

Chocolate Mousse - Creamy chocolate mousse tower lined with a cookie crust matched with (if I remember correctly) a blueberry compote.

Bacon Maple Syrup Ice Cream - The name says it all.  You need to try this bold dessert on your next visit!

All in all, we enjoyed a laid back night at Lardon along with good service and a well executed meal.  I can't wait to go back and see what the chefs have to offer as the season/menu changes.",4.0

cyUZsSbSwWXhM60Ln6CGuA,"My girlfriend and I were very excited to drop by this new restaurant and was not disappointed!


Highlight: The bruschetta rocked my world in ways I did not know it could be rocked.


The Vibe: unique and welcoming. This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.
 

The Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!


The Food: 

- Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)! 

This aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.

The only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.


- Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry. 

Whereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors. 


- CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!

- Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.


Overall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety  and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet.",4.0

Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended.
The menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you're left feeling optimistic.
But here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups, staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It's sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything.
The food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the ""Ragin Cajun,"" which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed ""meat,"" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the ""meat.""  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn't eat it.

Overall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it's location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I'll never go back, and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that's the kiss of death.",1.0
MQxu_QsTlsZGTd22U51jhA,"A nice small breakfast spot located across from Siems eye center and Dr. Tran's office.
I'm not familiar with this area, so it was difficult for me to find this place.
Came here for late breakfast.
The waitress (blond lady) was very nice and cheerful. She suggested me to get roasted pork belly benedict. Korean boiled eggs caught my eye so I decided to try that also. She said Dr. Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he's here and it's delicious. My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa. 

Roasted pork belly benidict... Delicious! Poached eggs were perfectly made. Roasted pork belly was exactly like ""Char siu"" you would get in some Ramen shop. Very fatty and melt in your mouths. I was expecting to get muffin type bread but the bread was like french baguette toasted very hard. I couldn't cut with the knife so I had to pick it up with my fingers and ate it. 

Korean boiled eggs... When I saw ""Korean eggs"" on the menu, I thought of ""Korean sauna eggs"" which you would get in Korean spas (they roast eggs in hot sauna for hours) but completely different thing came out. It was exactly like ""Nitamago"" or ""Ajitama"" you would get in any nicer Ramen shop. Perfectly done sweet soy sauce flavored Nitamago. I loved it!

It was nice for the chef to come out and talk to every customer that was there. He was a very nice person. He explained me how to make perfect Nitamago (well, Korean boiled eggs) with vinegar and stuff. I don't know if he's a owner chef or head chef but I hope this place gets a lot of business!!",4.0

2F_xCXajKuST7Q_Q_Xw7Jg,"I have an old-fashioned standard about fish tacos, which many taco places in Toronto fail.  A fish taco's focus is the fish fillet and the tortilla, not the garnishments.  Garnishments make a taco tastes better and unique, but they cannot replace the importance of the fish fillet.  Many taco places I have been to in Toronto want to wow customers with garnishments, but they go cheap on the fish.  They either use fish fillets not fresh enough, or choose a type of fish that is not meaty AND make the fillet too small, so the texture of the fillet is completely overshadowed by a big pile of garnishments.  The Combine Eatery passes the standard.  Yes, the tacos are expensive  The fillets are Basa fillets, a non-meaty fish.  Yet the fillet is big enough that the fish flavour comes through the garnishments, which are fresh.  The texture of the fish fillet stand up to the volume of the garnishments.  The fillet is fresh. The diner controls the spiciness level of the taco.  And this, my friends, is how I like a fish taco.",4.0

This trip was different, it's another story, and what can I say, this show is pretty awesome.  This is actually my first time to a Las Vegas show.  It's pretty much all Beatles music with a Cirque du Soleil performance of their crazy high flying stunts.  There is so much going on that you shouldn't get bored and you'll end up leaving thinking how did they do that?

The meals were delicious and hit the spot for us...we were so into our dishes that we didn't even get a chance to dig into the shortstacks - we ended up taking them home for a later splurge. I was a little bummed that they upped the prices by a couple dollars from what is listed on their website (someone needs to UPDATE that stat), but in the end it was still worth it. Eggs were cooked perfectly for both meals, the green thai butter used on mine gives it a nice kick of flavor and spice. Spam pieces were fried just right, not underdone (yes, this is possible) and not overdone. The tocino was marinated pork belly - again, great flavor and texture.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little details incorporated into each dish...garnishing was spectacular! The chef even came by our table to check on how everything turned out - that was a very nice touch...From other reviews, it looks like kitchen efficiency can be a hit or miss I guess depending on when you get there - glad we got there when we did, because when we left, the crowd certainly picked up and it appears that the kitchen got backed up from what another review states of their experience from today as well - I remember seeing that couple come in with their baby, it's too bad they didn't get a spectacular experience.  Hubby was greatly impressed with this place and that says a lot as it's very hard to please him. We are fans!",5.0
Mt5L6WlkeSxJOI8d00J0Kg,"The dollhouse was an excellent experience for myself and my two friends!  We wanted to have a girly night out, and of course, part of that involves getting our hair done.  I found out about the Dollhouse through a friend of mine, who highly suggested we try it out.  I am so glad we did!  They wash and condition your hair, massage your scalp, and put a fragrance of your choice into your hair.  I chose spearmint, which smelled heavenly!  Then, they give you a glass of water and champagne with a sweet treat in it.  I normally don't like champagne, but this glass was amazing.  Then they ask what kind of style you are looking to get, then work their magic.  My fine flat hair looked supermodel gorgeous when they were done!!!  My friends and I had such a fun time here, and I suggest this place to anyone looking for a girly thing to do with their friends.",5.0

I'm one that takes reviews into consideration but I also like to come up with my own. Arriving at the hotel it seemed nice. Slightly run down but nothing to bad. Upon entering the room was a different story. Immediately when we went into our room it smelled like sh*t literally. The ac unit on the wall only made it worse blowing out warm air. The carpet was dingy, the sunken tub was filthy and there were burn marks everywhere from the room to the restroom counter. Even though they advertise non smoking can't blame them for stupid people making breaking the rules. Within the first 5 minutes I honestly had to vomit from the smell and did. We immediately went back to the front desk and let Alicia know that we just couldn't stay. She was very apologetic and helpful and let me know that if I notified groupon for a refund she would honor it. So thank you Alicia for your customer service. If rumor can get the cleanliness in tact with the customer service that Alicia gave their profit and customer feedback can improve.",2.0

_kpiQtd-n_xXk_oY9m5PhA,"I went to Paul Mitchell The School after I saw a $19 Groupon for $30 towards a service.  I called at 9:30am to make an ombre hair color appointment with a Phase 2 student.  The receptionist was able to book me a 1:30pm appointment that same day with Jaymee.  Even though Jaymee is a student, she really knew what she was doing.  She was teaching a newer student (Rachel) about the techniques for ombre.  It made me feel very relieved when Jaymee was explaining each step of what she was doing.  Because I have very long, dark, and thick hair, I knew the appointment was going to take a while.  After starting at 1:30pm, I was out by 5pm.  This is understandable due to my hair and because students need to review their actions with their instructors.  Keep this in mind if you are thinking of coming here.  I feel 100% satisfied with my hair color service by Jaymee.  I also enjoyed the complimentary hand and arm massage I received from Rachel.  Overall I give the service I received 5 stars!  My ombre dye job cost $50, after I saved $11 from buying the Groupon.  What a great deal!  My suggestion would be to request a Phase 2 student (especially Jaymee!) if you are planning to get a color service.  It is well worth the extra ~$10.  Another great thing I found out is that men haircuts are $5 on Tuesdays.  You won't regret it if you come to the Paul Mitchell School.

Our group came in and we ordered the Captain's Boil, and the two other seasonings with mussels, clams,  and shrimp.  I ordered a fish and chips for myself as well as a side of corn.

First of all, the place is very conscientious of hand washing, with a washing station at the front entrance.  When you go downstairs, the washrooms have a sink inside as well as in the hallway!  Bonus points for that.  Also bonus points for their caesars which use a fresh stick of celery in it.

Food was a bit garlicky for my taste though.  The seafood came nice and hot, but the flavour of the garlic overwhelmed the seafood for me.  When I took the last piece of clam out of the bag, I couldn't taste the freshness of the clam anymore even though I could tell the seafood was fresh.  I was glad I got the fish and chips, which was perfectly fried and had generous portions.

It didn't help that the minced garlic tasted like it came from the industrial sized tubs you can buy in bulk pre minced.  I did use the sauce to dip my cajun fries with though, which is the best application of the sauces.

She tells me she can't get me in until next Tuesday. I ask to speak to someone else as she's made it clear it isn't up to her. She calls in a gentleman who is the only one who says halfway nice. He steps out and sends in another woman who is also AWFUL. She continues to repeat herself saying she doesn't know what to tell me and she can't help me.

The breakfast pizza was wonderful but on the smaller side and the goat cheese was applied unevenly resulting in 2 slices with a large amount and 3 with almost none.    Taking a few extra seconds to even it out would have been a big help.

Gm-l5_7w4kfiHCWUONYtgQ,"Made my online reservation with Hertz as part of my airline discount package in order to rent a car for the weekend of Electric Daisy Carnival 2011. Everything within an hour Vegas was BOOKED solid, and I mean solid. I was able to find one of the lodges 2 hours out of town that had space, so I was set. 

***Here is the important part of the entire review: I got a discount because it was PREPAID.

I got off of work, made it to the airport on time, checked in early, everything a-ok, even had my print out of my reservation and info to pick up my car rental at 10pm on Friday. I go to the ticket counter, and the staff is taking their time. Fine, I can still make it to the lodge on time and check in. This is also important, because the front desk is not open 24 hours. After midnight your screwed. The receptionist was willing to wait up til 1am for me to check in, though. But no later, as this place is so small no one else is at the desk until 5am. With only a few people in line in front of me, I should be ok.

Nope. Staff is so incompetent and computer system is so archaic that 30 minutes passes before the NEXT person is served. The manager tries to get people to use the Hertz electronic kiosk, as she can tell we are all frustrated with how SLOW the service is. I'm a savvy travel and think this should not be a problem and take the kiosk route with a few others. But the couple in front of me have issues with their reservation, and flag down the manager to help them (she is VERY pregnant and can't deal with the stress of 10 minutes of nothing working).

My turn at the kiosk. I try several different methods to get my reservation. Scan my print out. Type in my reservation number. Put in my credit card info again. 15 minutes of attempts, and nothing. By now I would've been in the front of the line. Finally the kiosk recognizes me, and tells me to SEE AN ATTENDANT about my issue. I get back in line and wait another 10 minutes before anyone can help me (thank God they didn't put me in the BACK of the line again). 

At this point I WASTE another 10 minutes as the reservations agent at the terminal can't get my reservation to go through, despite the print out and online info on my phone. THEY ARE SURE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY, BUT NOT GIVE YOU THE CAR. They cannot take the credit card I provided. YET THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY. 
When I showed them that I had been charged already (yes, I brought out my bank transactions, this has happened before and this usually works) they STILL WOULD NOT RENT ME THE CAR I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR. 

Now the manager gets involved, as she can sense my frustration with the staff to a perfectly simple and logical transaction. And what can she do about it? Nothing. Not willing to get on the phone and talk to Hertz, or to over ride. Is this for REAL? A rental service that operates 24 hours a day and you can't get anyone on the phone to fix this issue? And she wasn't going to try? EVEN THOUGH THE RESERVATION FOR THE RENTAL WAS PREPAID AND YOU TOOK MY MONEY?!

By now in my anger I had missed the call that the receptionist at the lodge was checking in with me. Whatever TIME I had buffered to make it to the extended deadline to check in at the lodge was now SLIPPING AWAY. Knowing that my frustration was mounting, I walked away and waited in line at another car rental agency and got a car. 

That's right. Walked up, waited in line 5 minutes, talked to an agent from a competitor and got them to MATCH MY CAR TYPE AND DISCOUNT with HERTZ and get the paperwork car within 10 minutes TOTAL. I went back to the HERTZ desk and asked to make sure I was getting a REFUND FOR A CAR RENTAL THAT WAS PREPAID THAT I WAS  *NOT* GETTING. 

Guess what the manager said?

No.

At this point I cussed out the agent that initially helped me and the manager because they know NOTHING about customer service. You can't release the cat to the same credit card you were MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE PREPAID MONEY FROM, and WON'T REFUND THE MONEY when you can't give me the car. No print out that says I was NOT given my car when I call Hertz billing come Monday. 

By now it's 11:30pm Friday night when I drive off in a non-HERTZ car, and I have to fly like a bat out of hell to make the deadline at the lodge. I would have to deal with Hertz later, as I had wasted enough time with them.

I've rambled enough, but in short guess who SLEPT IN THE CAR in the parking lot of the lodge? Surely it wasn't a HERTZ car that I slept in, no sir-ree -bob! 

In summary, even with all the paperwork, print outs, online info and correct identification info on my person, HERTZ would not rent me my prepaid car, nor would they refund it. Due to the length of incompetent  time and poor service I received at Hertz, I did not make my reservation on time at my lodging. 

AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.

We had a 7pm reservation, called in 4 days in advance, and we were seated at 8pm with no menus, no bread, no wine, except us whining that we felt like this was an episode of ""Hells Kitchen"".  

We had to laugh (group of 6) and we were not in a hurry, yet we had to ask for everything, server, wine, another wine, ect...  We finally got bread at 8:22pm, and after the bread the salad, and steaks came out pretty quick, but they could not figure out who's steak was who's...and the three women's steaks were all delivered to the wrong person, one had to be sent back, ordered M.R. brought M.W., not good...brought a new steak Rare...and the same person got shorted wine from the person as they tried to pour to all six  of us from a bottle of wine brought to the table uncorked with the cork in the bottle, not good...

All of that on our first visit ever to DC, and they did not offer us anything for compensation, no offer, no nothing...""sorry we are still learning""...""thanks for your patience""...""It's been overwhelming"" told to us by our server...

Similarly, dinner was reasonably good but there was nothing that was particularly amazing or stood out.  The roast beef at the carving station was probably my favorite.

oqAU_iv2P6VlG_csIkbDng,"Ambiance: 
Let's start with the location.  This Mexican-Korean fusion bar & restaurant is located in Korean town.  It is one of Playacabana restaurants or the MAS PLAYAS Group.  However it seems to be influenced by the neighbourhood.  That is why you can see many Mexican-Korean items on the menu like Baja fish taco with kimchi, K-Mex Slaw, etc.  Barrio Coreano can be a good choice for people who wanna explore a new taste of MEXICAN-KOREAN food.   The restaurant is quite small but I think they can accommodate up to 40 - 50 guests.  If you like RUSTIC DECOR, FUN & FRIENDLY ambiance and don't mind to be very close to other tables, you will like BARRIO COREANO.

Food: 
We ordered quite a lot because we didn't plan well , also misheard when our waitress told us that they ran out of the special beef steak taco.  We though it was the White Fish Taco that was out.  So we ended up ordering two items of fish tacos, the White Fish and Grilled Baja Fish .  
 
 - Fish Taco : The white fish taco was good but I'd prefer the baja fish which came with kimchi. Three baja fish tacos are for $13. If you have only one is $5.  We got three. They were very tasty.
 - K-MEX SLAW ($12):  We wanted to try something new so we ordered K-Mex Slaw as an appetizer. It came with a huge dish of Korean Cabbage, creamy fresh Mexican Cheese ""Queso Fresco"", fresh Avocado, Corn, and topped with Ginger-Sesame Dressing.  It was an interesting dish.  However, I am a chip-eater  so I ordered the Guacamole & Chips in the end   I couldn't finish it though.
 - GUACAMOLE & CHIPS ($9): I heard that their Guacamole & Chips were good however, it might not be my day.  My chips were a bit burnt and not warm as many people claimed .  The Guacamole was good though. 
 - GRILLED KALBI BEEF RIBS ($14): My husband ordered the ribs instead of the special steak taco that was run out.  He said these Korean Short Ribs were very good.  The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa and Cucumber-Radish Kimchi made the dish more delicious. The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa brought a kick of  spiciness. As I mentioned, if you like a taste of Korean food, you would like these Korean Short Ribs. 
 - *Dipping/ Hot sauces: Don't forget to ask for their house hot sauces! It is the MUST if you love spicy! I asked for it a bit late when I was about to fish my tacos .  I didn't plan well..I didn't plan well!  It came with four small bowls of different hot sauces.  The red one is the spiciest!!! 

Drinks: 
It's a bit harsh if you don't have Mexican food with alcohol, isn't it!?  Makes your journey a bit more fun with Michelada! A Mexican drink made with cold beer ""Modelo Especial ($7)"" and mixed with clamato juice, freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  I normally don't like Bloody Caesar or a drink with hot sauce.  However, this MICHELADA ($7+$2) totally changed my mind.  I became a spicy-drink lover .  

Barrio Coreano also have other interesting cocktails.  They are $12-$14.  We didn't get any cocktails this time.  We had only Michelada and Beau's Nordic Pale Ale (600ml for $12).  The Nordic Pale Ale is brewed in Ontario.  It was dry and low to medium bitter.  

Dessert:
 - CHURROS POUTINE:  a sweet version of Poutine.  Sweet Churros dipped in a rock glass filled with warm caramel and melted marshmallows . The dessert that you will fall in love with  if you like SWEET.  

Service:
 - Reservation: It is a good idea if you make a reservation.  We didn't do it though.  Luckily they had a small spot for us at the time because the customers was about to leave when we got in .  Make sure you ask your server for everything you may want at once so you won't miss anything and don't have to wait.  They seem to be busy in the evening, especially on weekends. 

Price:  In my opinion, it's a bit on high price side for some items.  However, taco prices are average.  I would recommend to order one each of tacos to try out with their house hot sauces.  A bottle of beer would be nice with spicy food~

Wanted to get reservations for a Wed. night but told that none were available so we decided to chance it.  Arrived around 6pm and was seated in the downstairs level, right at the table next to the bar.

Ordered some wine and appetizers to start - warm olives ($5), gnocchi ($5) and buttermilk calamari ($11).  Their calamari is usually a favourite of mine but this version was a bit over deep fried.  Texture was kinda tough.  The coating wasn't as fluffy as I once remembered.  Gnocchi was coated in a creme fresh and lemon but a bit bland tasting, not a lot to it.

For pizzas, we got the classic Margherita ($13), Cremini Mushroom ($17), Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula ($16) and the special of the day which was a pizza with lamb and rapini ($18).  

It's been awhile since I've had the mushroom one but it was great and I even loved it over my Margherita.

Desserts - how could we say no?  We went with the Tiramisu, Posset al Limone and Chocolate-Amaretto Budino, all $7 each.  The Posset was awesome...a light and refreshing lemon custard.  Tiramisu is always a winner.  Sweet and boozy, just how I like 'em.  The Budino was okay.  More like a chocolate mousse/pudding.

_on9HNc8kXj9rHSW9VVJnw,"Came with a large group for a special occasion.  We decided to see what's the hype in this prestigious duck.  Throughout the dinner, we experienced up-selling of the duck, why this duck is worth the price. Each employee had said different things - so here is a consolidation of the differences between $88 and $118 according to the restaurant:

The $88 duck is a 4 lb duck, vs $118 is an 8 lb duck.  Only the bigger duck have enough surface area to carve out the peony flower.  This flower presentation is also copyrighted in China as of 2014 - therefore you can only experience the unique presentation at their restaurants.

The duck is LOCAL. Regardless what they say, these ducks are not flown in from Beijing.  A waiter did tell us only the $118 is from a specialty farm, vs $88 is not (we asked the Manager to get the right story)

The pastry/pancake is from Beijing - to maintain its ""quality"". 

The finely green spring onions are specially ordered from a vendor - as it is unique in its ""fine chopping skill""

When you receive the duck at your table for the presentation of the carving, you will be given a show, including a ""gong"" to start the show, and to see how the peony is created.  

Was this duck good? It was tasty. However as the skin was so finely carved out, I found it was difficult to appreciate the crispiness of the skin. 

3 stars for the service - we did get a lot staff which came to explain to us on the restaurant history, the food detail, and explanation of the menu. We had a staff specially stayed around to serve us (why? I don't know why, he just floated next to us). HOWEVER, everyone was very courteous, and we appreciate their consistently walkthrough of each dishes and story-telling.

Were the other food good? They were all very flavourful - however generally more greasy, with higher price then typical Chinese restaurant.  We anticipated to have the Squirrel Fish, which unfortunately the waiter forgot to put into our order (our table did not make a big deal, as he was very courteous.

Waiter (Frank)-5 stars
Food-4 stars

The canoe appetizer was so yummy! But for 10 bite sized pieces of food, $26 is a bit much. 

My husband had the prix fixe and it's an awesome deal. The bi bim bap appetizer was tasty but a lil on the small side. His hangar steak was done to perfection. The soufflé dessert was great if you like super chocolatey stuff. 

I had the fish trio. The seared ahi was ok, but the salmon and butterfish were the better of the 3. If only the butterfish tasted more like miso like it was supposed to. 

Overall, great and solid 4.5. I'm from and love the one in Hawaii so that's the only one that gets a 5 from me :P",4.0

The waiter was very nice, and kept constantly refilling our drinks, which was very good. 

Food quality is OK.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, for the price you pay, the cocktail shrimp should be without shells, but it isn't. Also, the shrimp are kind of small compared to other buffets of the same price.   There was lobster tails, scallops, oysters, and many other seafood cooked in different ways, but nothing tasted outstanding. 

Sincerely, I was expecting something outstanding because this was all seafood, however it didn't surprise me at all.

I don't know how anyone can speak with such attitude and be so critical towards a customer that they don't even know. It was very strange and off-putting, I don't think I'll be returning.

My portion of food was decent, I wasn't able to finish it all (got a rude remark from the server about that), but my friends portion seemed very small. It tasted alright, nothing too special.

Our server was kind and attentive and I had a salad that a monkey could prepare well, so I'm giving two stars for those successes. But, my salad had no flavor besides a few olives to set it apart from a standard side salad you'd get for free at a Red Lobster or similar cheap chain.  The beets were just beets in a bowl, absolutely no flavor at all.  The margarita pizza my friend had was shocking considering this being advertised as a Mediterranean/Italian fusion spot, and she didn't have the heart to send it back.  It was clearly a cheap (or poorly, previously made) frozen pizza that they tried to disguise by throwing a couple of slices of tomato and a few sprinkles of unfrozen (note that I'm not using the word ""fresh"") cheese on.  She was starving and swallowed parts of two pieces, then I took the rest home thinking my husband or father would eat it since they'll eat almost anything, especially in pizza form.  Even they wouldn't eat it, so that was $8 or so in the trash.  I hate writing bad reviews without talking to the staff to give them an opportunity to fix it, but it was pretty clear that there was no pride or care given to the foods served there.  It was not the waiter's fault and no ""chef"" that allowed that kind of food to be sent out to a table would make a fresh pizza and flavorful second batch of beets had we sent them back.",2.0

Menu has a variety to chose from. I decided to try out goat karahi. I confess that it was a tricky dish to chose from because barring a handful almost all places in North America fail at it. And the it failed the authenticity test. Goat in Indian/Pakistani cuisine should not have that peculiar aroma that you commonly find in Mediterranean lamb or goat dishes.

Upon striking up a conversation with some other customers we learned this is one of the few places in the city to get true home cooked Bengali food. The mother of the family that runs the place apparently cooks the food just like she does for her family. And, after tasting the food, I believe it.

We didn't bother with the menu. Instead we just asked the young daughter of the owners to give us a sampling of their dishes, mostly the non meat ones. We ended up with an absolute feast.

To start we had lentil pakoras, a fried bread stuffed with lentils called dalpuri, and a chickpea-like dish with onions and potatoes called bwot. For mains we had a tasty spicy lentil soup, a vegetarian curry, and kacchi (beef) biryani, all served with delicious, fresh pratha.

Everything was good, but the kacchi was mindblowing. The rice in this dish had the most amazing subtle spicing. Not sure what was in there exactly but damn it was awesome. And extremely fresh. Only available on Friday though.

We finished with tea and a variety of desserts including a lovely pudding with caramel. I'm not huge on South Asian desserts but these were pretty good.

All this was easily enough to feed the four people in our group and we were shocked when the bill came in under $30. An unbelievable deal for this quality of food.

Recommended order: dalpuri, pratha, and kacchi biryani.

The ""wrap"" is a small tortilla that is folded around the egg thing and is somehow baked or steamed.  It was gross and inedible.

We had a reservation at 7 and they sat us promptly by the window so we could people watch. The vibe is casual yet somehow upscale. The décor reminds me of my mother's kitchen, comfortable with a touch of French attitude. The menu is fantastic and I wish we could have ordered everything. We did not feel like making our way multiple times to the chalk board which shows the menu. Our waiter was more than happy to give us appetizer and oyster suggestions and we went from there. The fried oyster appetizer was unmatchable. Three fried oysters assembled on top of a giant oyster shell had special sauce and lemons on top. The artichoke app was equally as impressive. I wish I knew the names of these dishes, but I was about 5 drinks in at this time. Of course my mom and I ordered the Lobster Spaghetti- after looking at everyone's pictures, you kind of have to. A Huge price tag comes along with this dish, however, the amount of lobster you are consuming is enough to feed the entire city of Montreal. I loved every bite of this dish and got more and more upset when my plate was becoming emptier and emptier (or I might have just gotten emotional from all of the wine).

The wine selection is never ending and the white that our waiter picked out for us was a perfect dry chardonnay. What was even better was that the couple next to us didn't finish their wine (that is unacceptable) and gave it to us. Their red was one of the best red's I have had.

There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude. They don't know what good customer service is, and I am warning everyone I know about them!",1.0

The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice.

AuRb_qohWKa_5fEy6KVClA,"Wow, guess my review was a bit premature.  I'm now going thru a similar experience with James G.'s review of 3/1/18.  I believe his story is spot on since encountering my own grief with the billing dept. of this office.  I spoke with Michael too, at exit of my last cleaning using their 12 month $299 plan, on 2/28/18.  He gave me options going forward for the 2 plans they offer and he said ""NO NEED to choose one now since I don't have a cleaning scheduled till 5/31/18.""  He said ""the plan is 12 mos so you'll waste 3 mos of that waiting till 5/31/18.""  I knew this already and was not going to choose either plan that day.  He made NO mention of needing to sign a letter rejecting an automatic renewal of that plan [which I was totally unaware of] by the next day 3/1/18.  Lo and behold, when paying my Capital One card Sunday 3/11/18 I see Cherrington Dental charged me $299 on that very next day, 3/1/18, without my consent.  Not only that, they DID NOT send me a receipt for that $299, so I had no idea it was done.  Had I not gone over my charges as usual I would have missed it.  Pretty low down sneaky and rotten thing to do to a patient of 1 year!  Where was the question, do you want to renew for another year, or change plans?  Or, will you have insurance this year??  Questions never asked.  

This is supposed to be a dental practice helping/caring for patients.  So, I called the Dental office and was told by Angie that Michael & Tammy were busy, that no charge reversal would be done, and that I would receive a return call that afternoon - 3/13/18.  Of course, no call came 3/13 or 3/14, so today 3/15/18 I called Capital One to start a dispute to reverse this nonsense.

Their signature drink the Shark Bite is your basic caffeine-infused cold beverage. If you like coffee and you need a shot of caffeine, you will find none better.

Still, service is good and they are friendly.

QHn-GipFW_WFcUabN55Row,"My gf suggested we eat here because they have ""better"" food, which I suppose is implied by the higher price they charge for dinner. 

This is not the case. 

When you're in Vegas (or anywhere, really) you have to remember that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet. 

Sure, they've got Kobe (not really, we aren't in Japan) beef, lamb, sushi, Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab, flank steak, shrimp cocktail...

... but it all tastes like buffet quality food, which is a better way of saying they're mostly terrible. 

Do you know how difficult it must be to coordinate a meal big enough to feed hundreds, if not thousands, or people? Do you possibly think quality can be a factor in cooking these meals?

Where is the satisfaction in getting a thick slice of Kobe beef if it's so tough your knife can't get through it?

Like king crab legs? Then you'll hate them here, since they're all machine-cut, partially frozen, and it tastes like they've been sitting in a salt water bath for a week. 

I wouldn't even mess with the sushi. I'm very, very picky about my fish, and whatever they were serving here looked one step above the grocery store. 

Even the desserts were mediocre. 

If you want to eat well in Vegas, go look up a decent restaurant and drop the $70 you'd spend here there. This last (and I do mean LAST) buffet visit proved once and for all that no matter what they're serving or charging, nothing beats paying for freshly made food. It isn't worth cramming sub-par servings down your gullet just to justify the cost of what you paid to get in here. Unless you have no discerning tastes, or you're just a big fatty who loves to binge eat (hey, no judgment here... do your thing) then this just isn't the place to waste money in Vegas.",2.0

Well, yea, it was, sorta.  But does poached mean there would be uncooked egg white and yolk running over the salad?  A fellow, seemingly ""in authority"" stopped by with the full expectation that we would lavish complements on the establishment.  We also told him about the problem.  No response -- he moved on.

I initially started my search for help and look for help on Yelp with contacting another well-known company.  However, that didn't pan out.  Luckily, I had found Roy with extensive research and he responded immediately and professionally on the phone, which shortly carried out with an inservice home visit.

Cindy is the best and one of her shellacs lasted almost a month! (With some tlc on my part).  They are pricey, which was previously my only issue. But worth it.  Sadly today I had my first negative experience and even more sadly it was with the owner Tina.  I requested a pedi and shellac and Tina worked on the pedi and mani, then handed off to Cindy for the shellac.  I was actually glad she did.  I know Tina is very busy which make me feel as if I wasn't being attended to and rushed- very rough pedi.  The salon had a bad bottle of Polish - color too thin - which I has picked out obviously unknowingly. I guess Tina thought it was mine because she spoke in a brusque tone about it and made me pick something else .  Only afterwards did she learn that it was their polish, not mine.  Perhaps Tina needs more staff so that she can focus on managing rather than doing nails because she seems way too busy to do a top notch job, which is what I've had from the other technicians up to now.  You guys are too pricey for anything else less than the best service.  Based on today I could have gone somewhere else and paid half the price for this level of service.

oNTaR4WcJgQbMoDktbrQ0g,"My experience seems to have differed from that of many people here.

Our waiter, Elias, was extremely efficient and friendly (ok, he did get a little snappy when he realized we'd finished eating a while earlier and hadn't called for him for the next course, but we were dining, not just experiencing the dark, and enjoying each other's company), never mixed up orders, projected his voice expertly so we always knew when he was coming to us and not to the next group at the long table (a gap of one seat on either side was left between us and their party).

My fish and veggies was quite good. I like breading and crunch on my fish, so that suited me quite well. The rice was lovely, though there wasn't much. The veg was slightly over-steamed green beans (my guest got steamed asparagus with his steak). I'd called that ""fish and veggie,"" no ""s"", but that's just a quibble. 

As previous reviewers have mentioned, you're hunting your food around the plate and more than once (especially with something like green beans, that can be hard to keep on a fork when you CAN see what you're doing!) you'll get a fork to your mouth only to discover there's nothing on it.

The desserts were sorbet and chocolate mousse. The mousse was delectable, though it had some sort of soft brownie or cake beneath; I literally couldn't get just one mouthful cut off and found myself with a HUGE chunk that needed to be nibbled off in the dark. I felt like a little kid, because without my napkin to scrub my face, I'd have left the room with chocolate *everywhere* on my face. 

I know some people find the ""atmosphere"" straining or uncomfortable in the dark. I was actually with a friend who is usually quite quiet, but was much *more* animated in the dark and we had a wonderful chat while we enjoyed our food.

The room is *dark*. They have double-layer black-out curtains to keep all light from the door or kitchen window out of the room; I'm *extremely* photosensitive so could just make out a bit of movement when my friend waved his hands at me, but that was it. 

The one warning I'd give, other than the ones given by others here (and I definitely disagree with some of them - we enjoyed our food and the service, though it wasn't the best meal either of us had ever had), is: 

If you are photosensitive, BE CAREFUL.

The moment I walked out of the dining room, I had *stabbing* pains in my eyes. So bad strangers were offering me sunglasses, and one of the sighted servers saw me in obvious pain and brought me to a very dark corner to give my eyes more time (she mentioned that they do, occasionally, get a customer like me, whose eyes don't adjust back quickly, and recommended I keep sunglasses on until I went to bed).

The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!

iJrt7x1TRawSKeEGK2p_-w,"Only reason I stopped in was because I wanted the Lorac mega pro palette 2 and Sephora doesn't carry Lorac anymore. 

I purchased the palette and when I got home the entire thing was covered in gold shadow, one of the shadows was broken and spilled everywhere.

I had to go back the next day and when I mentioned the need for the exchange I didn't even get an apology, she just said ""make sure you check this one"" which I had already done.

I also noticed that the Lorac section had a sign that stated a gift with purchase, when I mentioned it to her she said ""we ran out of the gifts"" not even giving me eye contact. I then told her, well then I suggest you take down the sign...to which she didn't reply.

It upsets me because this is a 60.00 eyeshadow palette (that's not cheap) and they act like they're doing you a favor. I know retail during the holidays is tough but they are like this year round. The customer service at this location is horrible, I'd rather go to Sephora or order online. I'm not dealing with their attitude anymore.",1.0

IC5-QaTSVZuzHG9LQ56z-w,"Had heard some good things about Marigold Maison and decided to check it out on a Sunday evening. 

We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers. 

We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.

For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency. 

Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none. 

The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of sautéed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion. 

The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus. 

With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was ""we are really busy and need you to leave right now."" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that. 

I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill. 

The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive.",2.0

Vhod6fuBKheaXbJX4gOEMw,"We stopped into The Social Page to look for some cool wedding items and ideas, although we didn't buy anything we did leave a little more inspired with some fresh ideas based on some stuff we saw. The Social Page started as an extensive and unique stationary store; they do appointments and consultations to bring your ideas from concept to completion. These days it's also a great local store that carries fashion accessories (mostly female), jewelry, toys, giftware, home décor, novelty items and other seasonal items. Despite specializing more in the stationary area they have some pretty cool gift/décor items which was why I wanted to visit.

The 3 biggest reasons I'd suggest checking out The Social Page is 1) They have unique stuff you wouldn't find elsewhere 2) They're diverse, they have a lot of little knick-knacks in a lot of sub-categories of giftware and décor, and 3) They're local! I'm a bit disappointed they don't showcase much of their wedding accessories/décor in-store as this was the primary reason for our visit. If you're looking for their wedding stuff as well you'll likely be re-directed to their online store. They have a lot of great items for weddings online, but what's unfortunate for me is it's really just a partner/affiliate with the parent company ""weddingstar"" when you shop online. weddingstar is a solid supplier, but it takes away from the local aspect a bit and it doesn't offer me much incentive to purchase indirectly from The Social Page subdivision of weddingstar since I could actually get better deals directly from weddingstar through their promotions :(.

jF5M5JAf1m49Mk_x__W7TA,"Whatever you do, stay away from any free deal these people offer for you to sit through their timeshare presentation!!! On the paperwork it says the presentation lasts for 2-2 and a half hrs. Well when we showed up, our salesman told us we would be with him for the next 3 hrs. He was so nice at first, got along with my friend and I, laughed a lot and then when we asked how much the timeshare was, he wouldn't answer and kept changing the subject. He took us outside to show us the ""beautiful view"" which was dead desert. Not too beautiful to me. He walked us to the common room where people hangout and watch tv, everyone had to be 75 yrs and older, I am 30. It seemed more like a retirement home than a timeshare. I noticed it had been over two hrs and thanked him for his time but we weren't interested. He said we were not allowed to leave until the 3 hrs was up. I told him I signed a paper which said I only had to stay for two to two and a half hrs. He said if we left we would not receive the free things we were promised. So at this point we have literally been blackmailed and kidnapped since what I signed said I could leave after two hrs.  I figured we could tough it out since it would only be another 45 minutes. That 45 minutes felt longer than the first 2 hrs. These guys don't know the word no, they do not listen to you and they turn into assholes after they know you won't buy from them. I said no about 30 times and the manager walks up, tells us a guy is selling his timeshare and I can get it for the price of $12,000. Half price of what the timeshare was (which was a complete lie) I said no. He then lowered it to $4,000. Again, I said no. He then offered me the timeshare for free and all I had to do was pay the $1,000 taxes each year and put down $1400 today and my week stays would be the $209 a week. I swear if I had to hear them say "" and for ONLY $209 a week you can stay ANYWHERE in the world"" one more time, I was going to scream. They made my friend cry out of frustration of not allowing us to leave  at the 3 hr mark and they kept pressuring us and wouldn't sign the paper saying we finished the presentation. It was like they wanted to make us so mad I would just sign up so they would shut up. When you don't listen to a girl when she says no, hold her against her will and make her cry and say sexual remarks about her body the entire time it's a close feeling to being sexually abused.....not okay.....At 3 hrs and 20 minutes we were finally told we could leave.....finally free. We were sent to another room to tell a man how our presentation went. As my friend was still crying we told him how awful it was. He had to fill out a questionnaire on our answers and the question on the page said ""how was the presentation"" after we told him how awful they were to us I saw him write ""good"" on the answer line.....he straight up lied on their questionnaire! I then was sent to another man to get my 4 free nights at the Luxor and my $200 deposit back. He said it would take two days to be put back into my account. It took over a week. When we got on the bus, everyone had similar stories. I was the only one who was dumb enough to put a $200 deposit down.

I was not impressed.  1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people.  They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines.  The thing that really upset me was the terrible service.  I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer me any direction on how to order.  I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line.  2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos.  3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn't wait to get out of work.  I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it.

1exFeTmxnq6AHFbvMXhKKQ,"I spent a week in Vegas and ate at a variety of restaurants on the strip along with a few local gems in Henderson & Old vegas. This spot was by far my most enjoyable and memorable dining experience of the trip with my two best gal friends.

To start, the restaurant is  BEAUTIFUL and aesthetically appealing in every sense of the word. We showed up an hour before close (so sorry we were running late), like many restaurants do I was fearful we would be rushed out the door and a turn and burn table. Instead, we had top knotch service. We were greeted by the friendly Manager Javier & our server Kobee. They were kind and informative and it was obvious that they were going to make sure it was a memorable experience for us.

We ordered many appetizers (do yourself a favor and get the zucchini flowers), a bottle of wine (Kobee recommended the lovely and tasty antinori peppoli), full entrees and everything from presentation to the obvious team work culture, to the TASTE of everything we had we were blown away and it was so lovely.  On top of all of that, they sent out a sample of a dessert liquor and dessert, a sample appetizer, and some champagne on the house. I kid you not- we asked for an experience and they gave us one. I was so thankful and it made the evening with two long distance friends catching up, the most pleasurable time imaginable and we thank Javier & Kobee for this!! What a beautiful establishment that I wish would come to washington DC! Thank you!!",5.0

My hot dog was 9.00, and it comes with chips (and you get no choice of chips) and some chili sauce. Was the food good? Yeah but not worth these prices. A meal like this should have only cost 9.00 dollars, water included.

Food specials are only $4.99 cheeseburgers w/fries, chili cheese dog, or some fancy fries. I usually get the cheeseburger and its been OK. The bloody marys are pretty weak and pretty tame. Service is extremely busy, and so its hit or miss after you initially sit down and order. 

Overall, its a nice bar with a raised table seating area, a large bar with gaming, and a couple of rooms for groups. TV's everywhere so you won't miss any of the action. I'll be back for sure to root for my Niners, and as they lose proceed to enjoy alcoholic beverages.",3.0

However, I had been to a dealership beforehand and was not satisfied with the care given to me.  The service advisor was not interested in my car problems and seemed to be more involved with talking to people on the telephone.  I waited too long and then decided to leave.  So my neighbor recommended Tuffy Auto Center at Rocky River Road to me.  I realized at the start that the service advisor was direct and seemed to know his auto business.  Sure enough after an hour's wait my brakes were adjusted, and my tires were inflated properly.  I thought that I needed new tires.  After an honest and thorough job, I will return to Tuffy Auto Centeer and will recommend others to do the same.

DZhZBOnMt4RbH47TH2-6-Q,"What a horrible experience! I came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon shortly after landing in Las Vegas. I came specifically because my co workers told me how great the Patron Milkshakes are and that the food was tasty! 

Well first blow to my experience was that they were out of Patron milkshakes! Can someone explain to me how a restaurant that is located on the strip of Las Vegas on a Saturday afternoon is out of anything?!! I was livid. They told me that they were out of the milkshake mix but not the Patron. Sounds like bad managing of inventory if you ask me. 

Secondly the customer service was horrible. They did not offer a replacement drink for my troubles and our waitress was switched out without warning and the first waitress gave us the wrong information. She allowed my friends to order $19 bottomless mimosas and then after serving the mimosas told them that the deal would end in about 10 minutes!! Wth!! Basically meaning that in 10 minutes they had to drink as many as they could. That's horrible. 

The waitress ended up taking it off of the bill but here is where it gets worse. 

The mimosas were watered down like they had been pre-made and were sitting in a pitcher of ice all day. They must do better than that. The food was disgusting. The English muffin on my eggs Benedict was stale and hard. The hollandaise sauce lacked flavor and my food was cold. I'm just so fed up with place. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. Maybe try Shake Shack next door. Come to think of it. I should've just gone next door ordered a shake from shake shack and told them to put Patron in it.

The first time they had a tough time because there was a group of eight people who got there before us, and there was so little wait staff that everything took a very long time.  Just eight people!  Anyway, I had the seafood pho.  The broth was very good, and I would say it was on a par with Saigon 8, which is one of the best.  The bowl of pho was interesting in a good way.  The fish pieces were actual good sized pieces of fish, not fish balls.  There were even baby octopus.

I was there a second time about a week later.  Service was faster.  However, there was a bit of a screw up by the waitress.  We got two bowls, and they weren't meant for our table.  I'd have eaten it anyway, and even put in sprouts, sauces, and so on.  I suppose I'd forgotten just what I'd ordered.  Then it was taken away.  My pho was pretty good, and by the way, I never saw that waitress again.

By comparison with other Viet Pho restaurants, there are differences.  They use lacquered chop sticks, rather than throw-away wooden ones as used by Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon.  The lacquered ones look classy, but are harder to use.  Tougher to hold onto the noodles.  Unlike other places, they bring the spoons and small empty dishes later, along with the meal.  My problem with that is that I cannot mix my dipping sauce while waiting for the rest of the stuff.  Also, they don't immediately bring out sprouts and greens and sliced peppers, which come out just before the pho.  I like using the sprouts to dip into the dipping bowl, kind of like you would do in a Mexican restaurant.  I know, it's just a whim of mine, but that's what I like to do.  Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon make it easy for me to do.",3.0

I ordered an appetizer and the waiter asked my BF which one he wanted, the waiter said, ""Oh you want to share the appetizer"" I said I assumed it was for 2 people, as most appetizers at almost any place can serve more than one person, and it didn't specify that they were single serve. The waiter was rude, as if I should have already known this information. 

So we were brought bread, a variety and this was actually fantastic. I was thinking that my meal would be great and the stuffy atmosphere would be worth it...I was wrong. I had pork shoulder that tasted like Walmart/enhanced meat. It was tough, fatty. Served with puree sweet potato that tasted like baby food. BF had ""seared"" tuna, that was just rubbery, nasty, no flavor. I'd give the meal 4/10...no lie a pork dinner from Bob Evans is better. 

I think this place needs to learn that sometimes less is better. Simple dishes can be better, dont need a thousand ingredients to be good. Overall the the atmosphere is what kills it. Its forced elegance. 

Pass. There are plenty of good places in the Burgh that have excellent food, but are comfortable and laid back, but still elegant.",2.0

Really nice and clean. Of course they just built it and it opened on Monday so I would hope so. It is a grand opening so all the corporate guys are there handing out cookie samples and coupons for free breakfast sandwiches. Line moved really good. A little confusing when we first walked in but figured it out. That is what you get for just blindly getting in line behind someone. Not as mobbed as I was expecting given that it just opened. Got right to the front of the line and food came out pretty quick. We got our food to go, a coworker and I, and took it back to the office to enjoy it.
I will definitely be back at lunch time or dinner time. Chick Fil A is great.

We had a huge group going, but it is summer time on campus, and few people

a few people arriving late, and their orders were taken maybe 10-20 minutes

4OjKAmo-4s3vmNrj0K1zVw,"Roadrunner Pharmacy has given me consistently first-rate service for two years now.  They provide metamazole in the form of a topical gel for my cat's thyroid condition.  Having that medication in a gel, which I apply to my critter's ears, is worth the extra price compared to the grief of trying to get pills down his throat without getting myself torn up.  Their prices are reasonable, service via UPS delivery is lightning fast.

On my most recent refill order I had to phone in because my credit card number had changed.  This is the ONLY criticism I have of Roadrunner and it's a very minor one - You can't enter a new credit card through their Web site.

On the other hand, the phone call was worth it because the person who helped me pointed out that I could save a bunch of money by having a larger quantity shipped (last two refills at the same time.)  She assured me that the shelf life of the product was long enough that it wouldn't be a problem having a two-month supply on hand.

IzmNx1qs4ZXEV4VqB8UoNw,"Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For ""shareable"",  respectable ""sashimi won-taco"" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The ""fondue dippers"" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

""Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie"".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A ""big dipper"" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The ""off-da-hook smash burger"" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the ""mac-n-cheese bacon burger""  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

There's a ton of restaurants that serve all different kinds of food that everyone can find something to eat. The Venetian is placed in a good spot on the Strip where we were able to walk to other hotels and see a lot of different areas. The look inside the hotel is gorgeous to the point that there are places inside the hotel that you actually feel like you're in Italy. I've been to Italy and there are some places in the hotel where I actually caught myself thinking I was back in Italy. If there was one negative it's that to get around the hotel or to get from your hotel room to outside the hotel it's a pretty big walk which I expected, but still after a long day of walking around to have to get to the hotel only to realize you have to walk a while longer to get back to your room was a bit of an annoyance.

The lighting and ambiance was very nice and casual, and their seats were very comfortable too. We ordered drinks, as well as some of their popular dishes: Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles and the Shrimp and Grits. For a starter, we ordered the waiter's recommendation of their crab cakes.

The crab cakes were super fresh and delicious. We popped them into our mouths and had to discipline ourselves to enjoy them to the fullest because the plate only had four of them. The cakes were paired with fresh greens and a tasty sauce, making a plate full of different textures. The food was savory, salty, sweet, and each taste didn't clash with one another. Just a warning though, like I said, the dish only contained four of them, so if you eat them up too quickly, you may end up regretting it!

The Shrimp and Grits dish was actually the first time I've ever tried grits before, and because of this, I now have high expectations for grits! Hahaha! Again, I have to say that this dish was also savory too (I love savory food). If only I could order more grits because those grits were just very fluffy and delicious! The shrimp was good too and both complimented each other very nicely. I would definitely come back to this place and order this dish again and again!

My friend ordered their most popular dish, Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles (I think that's how it's sequentially ordered...either way, you'll know what I'm talking about once you take a look at the menu yourself!). I especially LOVED this dish because it was their own twist on chicken and waffles. It's been almost two weeks, since eating there, so all I can remember is that it was one of the best chicken and waffles combination I've ever had. Their fried chicken was very crispy (I would have tried to request crispier skin, but I was already too hungry to wait for them to edit the dish), the waffles were sweet (even sweeter when doused in their maple syrup), and the watermelon was juicy! I do wish, however, that the dish had the full plate of waffles, instead of only using half of what was made in a waffle maker. For that price (around $33), they could have definitely added one more fried chicken and the other half of the waffles from the waffle maker. I'd get this dish again too!",5.0
nEcb3JY9kOzH1b9cAvxjHA,"If you're looking for a clean, safe and friendly storage place, then Security Self Storage is the place for you.  

For a couple of months I rented 2 indoor and 1 outdoor unit. The indoor units were in a temperature controlled building that was very clean.  If other renters were also in the building there are 3 doors I could choose from, so gaining access to my unit wasn't a problem.

The outdoor unit was very clean. The roads are wide enough to provide enough space to park your vehicle to load / unload while still letting other traffic to go past.

Another thing they provide is a FREE truck rental if you're within a certain distance from the rental unit. It'll save some money if you're in the right location and need to move things to your unit.  

If you're hiring movers they should have no problem getting through the security gates. I hired movers with a gigantic moving truck and they were able to pull through the gates without a problem. 

But ultimate what kept me happy was the extremely friendly staff. I was in a hurry and needed paper work quickly so I called ahead and they accommodated me by getting the paperwork ready for me to sign when I arrived. Fantastic staff, no fuss, very professional and superbly friendly.  

So if you're in the market for a storage unit, pop on by and their staff will help you find exactly what suits your needs.",5.0

I know this from previous dogs but it helps to reinforce with the owners too. I've seen dogs who've gone other places and eve done it myself once. Once.

Second and last visit, another $70 to have the doctor look at the x-rays that I didn't need and tell me they were negative (duh, really?)  When I requested pain pills for my aching shoulder, he said I didn't need any (yeah, right, but I needed the x-rays) and to just take an anti inflammatory (he probably thought I was some druggie or something.) Then he gave me a cortisone shot, which I really didn't want but since it was an anti inflammatory, it did help, and gave me a referral for an MRI. I never got the MRI and haven't been back since because it will cost me another $70 each time I go there, which is ridiculous.

rsVqYKtEZykBZqwur6QyVw,"Famous for its cheesecake and infamous for its two-hour waits, I must admit up front that I had no intention of liking this restaurant. I considered it to be over hyped and overrated; however, after a very satisfying early Saturday lunch, I now feel completely different.

We arrived at 11:00AM and were seated immediately, fortunately in Melissa's section. We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying.

For our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert. 

As an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not.

After drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good!

Hey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait.

Overall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun.

I ordered the Jean Lafitte Bowl complete with corn, black beans, voodoo chicken over top of white rice and topped with sour cream, cheese, and scallions. I have a few complaints about this dish. Firstly, it was way too sweet. Not just a hint of sweet...sickeningly sweet for a savory dish. The ratio of sauce to rice was approximately 1 part sauce to 2 part rice...barely any black beans or chicken. Also, rice was unseasoned and bland.  

Boyfriend got gumbo and jambalaya. To me they were lacking spice and flavor. Again, both were incredibly underwhelming. 

Drunken chicken po boy was decent. Needed something else than just chicken on an open faced bun. Perhaps coleslaw for texture and interest?

I ordered a bento box with sushi, sashimi, and tempura.  I had Zipang for lunch the day previous, so my review might be a little bias.  The nigiri sushi rice was a little too large and too tightly packed for my liking.  It should really be packed enough to pick up by a pair of chopsticks but falls apart in your mouth without much chewing.  The fish in the sushi and sashimi were not that fresh to be honest and were thinly cut.  The saving grace was the tempura, which I thought was quite good.    

Overall, for the given price, there are better sushi options around.  Maybe their thing isn't sushi/sashimi but it makes up a large part of their menu.  To be honest, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  If I happened to be here another time, I would order their cooked food instead.",2.0

A new-age southern style restaurant in the heart of Venetian.   Quite a few exemplary choices here, just with the strip prices you'd come to expect.

Let's start with one of the best Fried Chicken dishes you may encounter :

Chicken n' Watermelon n' Waffles ($36): Honey Hot Sauce, Chilled Spiced Watermelon, Cheddar Cheese Chow Chow Waffle & Bourbon Maple Syrup. The most tender and juicy fried chicken I've had to date, the waffles crisp and flavorful. I prefer my fried chicken to be full of spice, but this was an excellent rendition!  A bit spendy, but worth the go ahead with the large sharing portion.

Mama's Chicken Biscuits ($14): Free Range Fried Chicken, Pepper Jelly, House Pickles & Buttermilk Biscuit. Incredibly fluffy, buttery sweet biscuit with lightly battered chicken, moist and flavorful. Recommended!  I could eat these biscuits for days :D

Low & Slow Smoked Chicken Salad ($16): Haas Avocado, Warm Cornbread & Yogurt Dressing. Loved the cornbread texture and flavor, the chicken full of flavor and pairing perfectly with the yogurt dressing. Wonderful! 

Fried Green Tomato 'BLT' ($14): Pork Belly, Greens, Tomato Jam & Pimento Cheese. Succulent pork belly, fat rendered and buttery, with a nice crunchy cornbread and pimento pulling it together. 

Fried Bread & Butter Pickle Spears ($6): Spicy Salt & Spiked Dukes Mayo. Light breading, similar to Fish & Chips consistency. Dipping mayo very enjoyable!

Deviled Eggs ($11): Fresh Dill & Smoked Trout Roe. Well balanced and fresh, the roe adding just a hint of salt to finish

Chicken Liver Toast ($5): Grilled Country Bread, Cuke & Fresno Pepper Relish. Mildly mineral in flavor, the acid in the relish complimented well. 

Florida Heirloom Tomatoes ($16): Toasted Peanut Hummus, Basil, Smoked Tomato Sorbet, Field Shoots, Crunchy Puffed Ca. Dressing was very enjoyable with a nice addition of peanut hummus 

Macaroni & Cheese ($10): Torchio Pasta, Five Artisanal Cheeses & Crispy Herb Crust. Well rendered, just missing some spice to set it off from the cheese.

Country Pork Terrine ($10): Pickled Cauliflower, Grilled Country Bread & Whole Grain Mustard. Very heavy and lunch-meat like terrine, it paired well with the mustard. 

And for dessert :

Key Lime Donut Bites: Coconut Pudding & Mango Jellies. Interesting combination with the citrus, I enjoyed the pudding / mango jelly, light and delicate.

Crunch & Munch Bread Pudding: M&Ms Bread Pudding, Popcorn Ice Cream & Candied Pretzel. Incredibly sweet, the bread pudding was thick and rich, almost brownie-like.  A bit too sweet for my tastes, but one can figure that out reading the ingredients.

Bacon Butterscotch Cake: Pecan Pie Filling & Bourbon Ice Cream. Delicious cake, fair bacon flavor throughout, with a very crispy bacon piece for garnish. Good! 



Stick with the fried chicken, biscuits and cornbread concoctions, and you will fare well!

As I piled into the back of the shuttle, and watched it fill up, I thought to myself, ""This must be a popular place."" Boy was I wrong. As we all lined up for check in (half of us out the door), the front desk announced that they only had one computer working and it would take some time. I was number 7 in line. As I made it up to the marble counter and said hello to the person checking me in and the 4 others who were behind the desk, I noticed that ""old"" smell..... You know that smell that makes you think mildew? Mold? Nope, it was the natural perfume of the entire building (at least the parts that I was in). I was given my room, and I walked in and noticed a GIANT stain on my recently redone carpet, the light fixture was leaning to one side and falling off the wall, and my AWESOME view was a giant satellite dish and what looked like some rusted out shacks in the parking lot.
So I grabbed the remote and was greeted by a bunch of back buttons (the numbers had been worn off). The only one I could read was MENU and it did not work. After figuring out which buttons did what (Thank God I did not end up accidentally buying hotel porn!) I started trying to change the channel. I could change by using the button to look at the next channel up or down the list, but if I hit a number, it would simply sit on the screen. If I wanted channel 24, it would first show channel 2, and after hitting 4 like 5 times, the 2 would be replaced with a 4 and it would sit there until I turned the TV off and turned it back on.
This hotel was a lot like the Monday Night Pre-Season Game I was watching... Not inspiring confidence. After calling down to the front desk and asking for a 7:30 shuttle and a 7 am wake up call, I eat my delivered dinner (I dare not try the hotel's food) and set the Hilton Clock in my room for a 6:45 alarm.

The next morning I woke up on my own at about 6:50 to my alarm clock blinking because the alarm was going off, but the alarm itself was broken. As I walked towards the bathroom, I noticed 2 pieces of paper under my door. It was my bill, but you would not know it. Usually Hilton family hotels print everything (including your bill) on company letter head so you know where it came from. These bills were simply printed on white copy paper.

TR-QFoEfzPs-qg1A4SU6xg,"I'm giving this Costco a tentative 4 out of 5 stars. The primary reason being, the parking lot sucks. There is no shade, so afterwards you're really inclined to take your car to the Costco car wash and fork over $7.99 for a wash.

Now, with the negatives out of the way, I have to say that the Costco has all the requirements of a Costco. Perishables are lumped together, except for dairy, which you have to go down the side to find the dairy cooler. Counter intuitive. It'd be nice if all Costcos could follow the same warehouse schematic, this would make shopping easier for customers.

Or, if Costco does not want to have a unified schematic, then have an app available (yes, that means Costco would need to provision guest wifi access points and available SSID's for connect), so that customers can pull down a user intuitive layout. Marketing opportunity: The customer can then visually see the available items on sale in the store. Pair it along the Costco app or bake the schematic feature directly into the Costco app so that shoppers can shop smarter.

Also, as of early 2016, Costco now accepts credit cards. I shit you not. They killed their agreement with American Express and instead went with Citibank. Caveat: you can't use your costco business card with Apple Pay. Google it, lot of pissed off customers.

8gmBLNtN20Gmna7it2TeQw,"Wonderful place to eat in the touristy area of Old Port/Old Montréal. 

After attending a terrific performance at Cirque du Soleil we were hungry for a late dinner and some cocktails. After walking around the area looking for a place we peeked into the back courtyard of Jardin Nelson and immediately knew we found our spot.

The back courtyard at night is all lit up wonderfully with large umbrellas overhead, flowered plants and trees, along with a band and amazing singer crooning old standards. The setting is magical and we loved it. In fact, we went back on another night during our vacation to Montreal to enjoy it again. We ended up with the same waitress both times and she was just outstanding, and she remembered us too.

Great service, fresh tasty food, good drinks, romantic ambiance, live music in the back courtyard - we loved it all. Highly recommended over many other spots to eat at in the area, and I feel it's even better to come here without children at night if looking for a more romantic and adult kind of dining experience.

STweQ93XcHpIP59rXS5zlQ,"Went there last week on a Friday

They don't take reservations. They give you a buzzer and u wait until it buzzes. They told us it's a 1.5 hr wait ...It took 2 hrs for us to get a table. 

The reason I assume it takes so long is that you are almost guaranteed that everybody will have dessert (cheese cake) and they will savour it (take their sweet time) then talk some more and then pay the bill


Either way we got our seat and I must say that the experience after that was great

The place was packed !!!! And I dreaded thinking the food will take as long as waiting for the table but I was wrong .... food came quickly, it was delicious (i had pasta napalitano) the portions were huge (could have shared the pasta (2350 calories!!!)

For desert I had the Nutella cheesecake and it was delicious

Got the combo plate with Hengrenade Chicken, Machaca, Black Beans and white rice....the Hengrenade Chicken was really kicking my butt! The spiciness doesn't kick u in the mouth until a few minutes later after swallowing it. Nonetheless it was very delicious..I didn't get anything that was Chinese but my bf did order the Carnitas, Jade Red Chicken, Black Beans and plain fried rice combo...the Jade Red Chicken was really good. So for a combo of two things and the choice of rice and beans is $7.25....it doesn't come with a drink but it does come with a delicious snickerdoodle cookie! 

Needless to say we both enjoyed our yummy lunch here today. The only thing was I got a cup for water but I didn't drink the water because it was tainted with something pink....and I was a bit afraid of drinking it...=/ It's not a true hole in the wall restaurant so it was pretty spacious and clean.

I am not sure why the reviews aren't higher, but the owner/manager of this franchise (Gary) is extremely personable as is the female that also works there.  I haven't spoken to anyone else.  The establishment is new, and clean and the service is quick.  The Fish and Chips are great.  The batter is light and airy, and the chips are pretty good.  I'm guessing the incident of not double frying was limited to one day.  I've been there at least 3 times and the fries have been on point.  Overall a good place to eat.",5.0

It is really cheap. Definitely worth the trip to downtown for a cheaper buffet. It may be out of the way, but if you were to explore the downtown area, then it is worth the trip.

Very cool that you can see the grill and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere. Bar is optional and they do have the newer style coke machine which is a nice option if you drink soft drinks.

The wings are some of the best in the valley! Zipps are my favorite, so you get a gist of what type of wings I like. The ranch here is the real deal as well, which makes a difference. Not bottled or bagged ranch like many of the restaurants use.

The ONLY issue I have here is that the burgers are cooked WELL done. Xtra well my visit yesterday. BUT, still are great because of the charbroil flavor. I usually order my burgers rare to medium rare (don't have that option here), so I'd rather get a burger at Fuddruckers, but the fries are better here... and the wings and other sides are great options that separate OHW from other restaurants.

RpTmFI0HEln4egTJclUn_w,"hi,  place posts own fake good reviews, this is a REAL review from a REAL person
:
this  is the worst restaurant i have been to in las vegas, first: their baked goods are old and hard ! they buy their bagels frozen and defrost them ( i saw the bag).
the food is awful, . we ordered brisket sandwich, potato salad, chicken soup, salmon platter, pastrami sandwich, hamburger with cole slaw (the hamburger was immediately sent back it was hard and flat as a hockey puck :  (    cole slaw was gross and slimy, ... the sandwiches were tasteless
the pastrami : not edible, the soup was cold and from a can, the potato salad came from a plastic tub. they are making nothing homemade as they ""claim"", the salmon was a salmon substitute ( very gummy after one bite, i was afraid to eat anymore in a chance i would become ill).. all of their food is frozen and microwaved.go buy a frozen sandwich, microwave it thats what our disgusting sandwiches tasted like for quadruple the price!!.. the waitress told me and rolled her eyes, she also told us she found a new waitress job because they have to tell customers food is homemade when nothing is made there and she did not want to lie to customers. i repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE",1.0
D9prgmysvcdnvP4vK5aqJA,"Can never go wrong with anything at Pita Jungle. All of the portions are quite large and perfect for sharing or taking home for a snack or dinner later. 

On my recent visit I had the grilled veggie salad and it was huge! My lunch date had the broiled chicken wrap and it was huge too. On my previous visits I've had the hummus which is always a great choice (the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus is my fav), the portabello burger was ok. A bit hard to eat. Not sure I'd have it again. The Hummus with Chicken was tasty, the Nachos are HUGE and very good. The soups are great too. Like I said, anything you get here is great and very fresh and tasty. 

The inside isn't very big so tables are very close to each other while you can opt to sit outside. I usually sit outside even in the hot summer months because it is shaded and there are misters so it's actually not bad and you get full services outside. 

One downside to this location is the parking like others have said. There is never enough parking for all the dining choices that are located in this shopping center. I always either try to go before noon or wait until 12:30 or a little after and I'm usually lucky on finding a spot.",4.0
UONp9qGjjuf3I4JX4IwdVw,"1) Food - The food is delicious and looks good too. It was better than some of the food I've paid double for at sit-down restaurants. Five thumbs up.

2) Service - I made a point to mention to the cashier that the food was delicious and whoever made it could cook. (When I dropped by all of the staff were clearly either teenagers or very early 20's.) The cashier laughed and told the rest of the staff who all had a chuckle over this. Overall, the staff was nonchalant and indifferent. Not necessarily rude but perhaps uncaring. I do hope they don't film each other bathing in the sinks after closing.

h8Ytm8knSgYrQS1kxGKCug,"I covered some of this in my review for the Princess of Wales theatre, but I will mention it here. The Royal Alexandra is best when you have really good (close) seats. It is worth it to splurge on pricier tickets at this location. The Princess of Wales is a little better for distance seats. 

I always enjoy shows here. The last one I saw was The Boys in the Photograph and I have to admit, I didn't know what the musical was about until about 2 hours before it started - but it was awesome. 

Snacks and drinks are very expensive, so eat before you go. You can bring alcoholic drinks to your seats, so that helped him get through the show. 

The seats here are not the most comfortable - getting up and stretching your legs at intermission is key. You will regret it if you don't. 

Also mentioned in my review for the Princess of Wales theatre: I don't know how bad it is for men, but women, you MUST pee before you go.

We got there just before the lunch rush and scored a prime table near the windows (tho upon leaving, my friend noted how cozy the sofa-bench tables looked, so I'll aim for one of those next time). Our server, Robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world. Even after the restaurant filled up, he was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal. 

We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeño sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. 

The decor was comforting in a British pub style. I wish the menu had been more unique (burgers, BLT, variety of salads), esp for a place with the wird ""arrogant"" staring at you.

0BDqRJvrHfe3yQTujws1dQ,"I heard about global minds through my cousin who sent his son here for many years (until he started kindergarten).  i came with hesitation as i was touring the school with the youngest of my three kids - to see if she would like it.  first off, my shy little girl found the school environment so friendly and inviting that i had to drag her out to leave that day, and then all she kept talking about was how she couldn't wait to get to her new school.  

i have had experiences with my children attending preschool programs at various institutions locally -- including rainbow montessori, cherokee pre-K program, desert sky montessori, and i can say with confidence that Global Minds has been the biggest hit with my child, and for us as parents.  This school combines the warmth and loving environment that we all want for our kids with a strong love of learning and play.  my older boys (who are learning mandarin at BASIS) are so **jealous** that their 2 year old sister knows more mandarin than they do!  she is singing songs in spanish and mandarin, learning to count, and saying casual phrases in both languages.  she is so happy and never cries when we pull up in the morning, but just RUNS out of the car to get into the school.  My older children were upset that they did not get the chance to go to global minds themselves!  

Contrary to some of these negative reviews regarding Adam and his bullying tactics -- i have found that he is beyond understanding and goes out of his way to accommodate families and their situations.  when i signed up for the school - i forgot to pay the deposit, and it was actually ME that had to track him down and make sure that he let me pay (as i didn't remember the exact amount i needed to give him).  i was so worried that i would have lost my spot in the school - but Adam stated that he had held it for me despite my lack of deposit - and was very understanding about the situation.

Adam and all the teachers at the school also helped as my daughter transitioned and potty trained.  before she started she was successfully having no accidents.  in her first week she had 1-2 every day!!! not only did they just help her adjust (and change her with the clothes i provided them) -- but since the second week she didn't have any accidents!

Our server was very accommodating and attentive enough to be accessible within a minute of our needing him. Veggie springs rolls were good. The Anise Noodle special was also quite good - simple and tasty.

Good Thai tea is comprised of a tea base mixed with milk just BEFORE serving.

I enjoyed a nice cold Hacker Pschorr Munich Gold draft on tap tonight with my fish sandwich and perfectly seasoned potato cake with applesauce.  They feature more than 27 beers on tap which is nice and have a full bar area with high top tables and some games. 

Their fish batter is a tad bland but the fish was white, fresh, and meaty so that sort of made up for the batter.  The potato pancakes were exactly like my dear Mother used to make: shredded potatoes with minced onion and egg that is formed into a cake and pan fried on high heat to give the outside that crispy texture and keep the inside moist.  My partner loved the coleslaw too. 

The chairs and tables are beautiful rustic wood with a dark stain that must have recently been refinished.

Free wi-fi, pool, tic tac toe, connect four, life sized chessboard, Giant Jenga, beer pong on steroids - and an airstream. I mean, really!

 If you're looking for an upscale vibe that's smokefree and ching-ching-ching-slot-machine-ring free, this is the place to be. Drink prices are more strip like and there isn't a happy hour (Damn it, Jim) but the ambiance and free games somewhat make up for it. But, a happy hour would be nice - just sayin! 

Food prices are fair - we had a happy grilled cheese that wasn't all that happy (the bread is more like a brioche and the cheese doesn't melt into it very well) and the portobello mushroom sandwich (delicious!). Everything else looked good on the menu and we will definitely go back to try a few of the 50 different sauces available for wings. I don't eat chicken so maybe they will add a popcorn shrimp or something for pescetarians like me.

The kanapki ($6) were great and are also offered on a rotating basis of delicious flavors. The carrot puree was my favorite. After eating delicious comfort food, don't forget to save room for dessert as they offer some great options. The apple tart ($5) was sweet and sour and savory all in one and I would definitely recommend it.

Overall, I really appreciated how this meatless restaurant was able to flaunt that fact with interesting flavor combinations.

HMh8mRqLIQZZ82qW3IWLAw,"So about a week and a half after having some of the best BBQ St. Louis has to offer (Pappy's for those in the know, check my prior reviews) I was back in AZ and ready for some. Having a week off and several friends who were fellow fans of BBQ I decided it was time to make the trip over to Little Miss while I was able to get there early and not have to wait long. Got there about 10:30 and by 11:10 I had a nice plate of juicy meat in front of me ready to go.

Lucky enough for me I came on a thursday which meant it was Pastrami day and a platter full of that, fatty brisket, beans, potato salad and an extra housemade sausage for good measure I was ready to indulge in all the essentials for BBQ.

I have to say I was blown away by the flavors and the tenderness of the meat hear. The pastrami was incredible with a blend of spices that was out of this world there was a distinct subtle sweetness that I couldn't put my finger but it was a hit probably the best I have ever had. The fatty brisket was just killer as well with a great tenderness and ton of great smoked flavor. The biggest compliment I can give these two meats is that while I tried them with the various sauces I preferred them without and I am usually the type to slather my BBQ in some sauce.

The homemade sausage was really good as well and work getting with some great flavor but was overshadowed by the others. The beans are more liked pulled pork with some beans added, in other words outstanding. The potato also didn't disappoint.

One of the staff also noticed my buddies 2 young children weren't eating anything when told they were picky eaters he said ""let me get the a rib to try kids tend to love them"" and he was nice enough to bring a rib for each youngster. While the kids still didn't go for it after a little test bite the rest of us decided to try and they were very good and fall apart tender as well. In the absence of the Pastrami I would pair the ribs and brisket in a heartbeat for a great meal.

The finishing touch was the pecan pie which while small is rich enough it should be shared but it will go quick as the smokey sweetness and flaky crust is perfect capper to a great meal.

Compared to Pappy's I may actually give the edge to Little Miss because of the Pastrami but it's neck and neck on ribs and brisket so the end result is that AZ has a BBQ spot that can go toe to toe with some of the best in the midwest.

I will never come back.
Service was bad, food was bad (except the soup), atmosphere was nice although it opens into the slot machines at Luxor.

If you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.  
I had to get up and get his attention because he couldn't see me.
The girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).

The Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.

The steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.

The wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I'm not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn't even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad.

2KdToNV9L8ycvpOiSYKOHQ,"Teharu is supremely average. The clientele left something to be desired (I guess that's not their fault though), as when I visited it was full of ASU students. The music was some terrible Billboard 100 mix. I don't know, when I eat sushi I don't really want to listen to what's on 97.5, I guess. 

Anyway, the food was pretty terrible. I do like the conveyor belt style, since it's a cool part of eating sushi in Japan, but I feel like they didn't really pull it off. Instead of a small amount of fresh sushi going around, it was packed full of rolls that could've been there for hours, getting warm (I didn't notice any quality control). We visited a while ago so I can't remember what exactly I tried, but it was forgettable. Tasted like grocery store sushi; very fishy and didn't have a really fresh flavor at all. Even for the price (dirt cheap), it really wasn't worth it for SUCH a sub-par meal. The cream puffs were pretty good though, and I was really amused at the snack-paks and apple juice cartons going around too. 

I've seen some reviews complaining about the service, but I thought the service was actually pretty good. Just had to signal someone to come over for the check and they were very attentive and nice, quick about getting it to us and giving my card back.

There is good security at the door - the guard asks where you're heading to or who you're visiting at the gate which keeps out random wanderers. Nice bar across the street too if you want some quick and affordable food.

You're basically in the middle of nowhere, but though I have not personally tried it, I hear there's a shuttle that takes you from the resort to the Strip.

When you consider how even really crappy hotels have free wi-fi, it was ridiculous and annoying that a nice place like this didn't offer it. Luckily we were only staying 2 nights.

0yT671BtntdQPAyzTird4A,"This place has only been open a little over a week now, but we went there on Friday night at a friend's suggestion.  I had a falafel sandwich, my husband had a chicken shawarma sandwich combo. 

Both were delicious, and my husband claims it is very ""authentic"" (which I believe, although I'm not sure how he got to be an expert on Middle Eastern food since he's only ever eating shawarma in Toronto).  The guy making our sandwiches insisted that my husband have french fries on his sandwich, because ""that is the way they do it back home"" (back home being Lebanon, I asked).  He tried it out and said it was fine, but nothing spectacular.  Sure enough, the guy behind us in line wanted fries on his, and he reiterated ""that's the way they do it at home!"".  So maybe my husband is right, maybe it is really authentic.

The combo came with fries and 2 sides (choices are babaganoush, hummus, and tabouli).  The falafal balls were made fresh and had a nice crispiness on the outside, and were moist on the inside.  

The place felt very clean and had that still-new feel to it.  Service was friendly and attentive.  

However - and this is a BIG however - the guy working the grill was SWEATING PROFUSELY.  Dripping-down-his-face-and-maybe-onto-the-food-type sweat.  This is HUGE in my opinion, and almost enough to turn me off the place forever.  But I kept a close eye on my sandwich and feel okay about it.  The reason I still give 4 stars, is because I think the food was great, and this place has huge potential, and this one significant issue is relatively easy to fix.  Get a few fans, some better ventilation, and problem hopefully solved.  Also, give the guy a towel in the back to wipe his face on, so that he doesn't have to keep wiping his face on the sleeve of his shirt.

The food is simply wonderful!! I love the noodle soup. The broth is miso-based (perfect for vegetarians) and has lots of delicious buckwheat noodles and fresh vegetables. The fried rice with tofu is also delicious.

Two things really stand out to me about this place, other than the healthfulness of its delicious food: 

1. It is REALLY inexpensive. I think the fried rice (a big portion) is only about $3, and the soup is $5 or less.

2. The owner is one of the kindest people I have ever met. He isn't overly friendly or chatty, but just seems to be a person of great humility and character.

Service and ambience are terrific. And the food was good... Great even... Just... a little uninspired.

I think I just find it very difficult to fall in love with most restaurants in Las Vegas with this model - I understand that everything is going to be expensive, and well done... But I tend to be dissatisfied with the model. 

Over priced food, is over priced... This place would be fantastic if prices were like... 15% more affordable. As one who doesn't mind spending on a great meal, I hate spending $40 per person on a  mimosa, tacos, and chilaquiles brunch. That's all.",3.0

We were told to just ""stay at home since we lived in the area"". I was then told to just sit down so he could take care of other people and was ignored for 20 minutes. Eventually, we got a room by paying double even though we had a whole wedding party staying there and booked something over 6 months ago. 

Next, the bar. We stopped by after our reception (in our wedding attire), and were ignored for about 20 minutes before being told that they can't make what we wanted or much else, again with a sarcastic and rude attitude. 

Lastly, as we were trying to just get out of this place, we called down to see if we could get a valet to help with our bags. I was told to just get it myself and received no help. Happy to be leaving. 

Overall, this is the WORST customer service I have ever encountered. When you work in the hospitality business, you should NOT be rude, sarcastic and cold to your patrons, which was especially horrible considering the event. I will never stay at a hotel indigo again.",1.0

NdgQBCPlcOGl0DdTV1U9tQ,"Contrary to my fellow Yelpers, I had a really rotten experience at Canteen. Canteen is an upscale Mexican bistro, located in a restored building on the east side of Capitol Square. 

We were served circular corn puffs seasoned with cumin (I guess instead of tortilla chips) as the free appetizer. They were basically giant rice crispy cereal pieces - not exactly amazing. 

Things went downhill fast when my mother ordered the carne asada tacos. She ate most of the taco, which, by the way, tasted average. She happened to cut a piece of the beef in half. The beef was thoroughly raw and the fat wasn't even melted. I have ordered medium rare steaks around the world, but this beef was completely blue/purple - it was downright unsafe. 

The rest of the meal was mediocre-average. The refried beans were dry and stale, but the fried corn was pretty good. 

When I complained to the staff, we got most of our meal for free and we also got a free dessert. My mom had lost her appetite, but I settled on the churros. The dainty churros were tossed into a paper bag (I've seen better presentation at the state fair). These were the worst churros I've ever had. They were completely stale and greasy. They smelled like expired, cheap soybean oil and I had to spit out the small bite I took. 

When I got home (not surprisingly) I had terrible stomach pain.

i did not like that they do not have carry out menus, especially for the deli side....the cook did say that we could pull up everything on the website, which coincidentally enough, i could not find when i looked today. i did see lots o pics, but i am a  girl who likes to see what you have to offer, and prices....(they do have their catering menu posted) which all of it sounds purely  delightful.....

I understand there are some cost involved in getting these reports but I paid it and moved forward.  We were approved without any problem and I am attempting to schedule a closing date and move in.  Well today, August 3rd I find out this community will not allow us to sign the lease or move in until I can deliver to them a copy of the title for the modular home with my wife and me listed as the owner.

I can pay for the home start paying the insurance to cover the property but I cannot sign the lease and move in until the state of Ohio issues a title with my name in it?  In the state of Ohio that can take up to 30 days.  This is the CRAZIEST THING that I have ever heard!

So I hope someone from Columbia Park or their parent company is paying attention to reviews and social media.

Well at least I thought it would be a good time. When arriving at the desk we were given 3 tickets well at least I thought. When it came time for the meet and greet we were stopped at security because we were told are tickets would not scan. When we went back to the desk no one seemed to know what was going on with are tickets as all the works scrambled around from computer to computer to try to solve what wad going on. It was at that time another employee came up and told us that if we didn't come now we would miss the meet and greet. The front desk told us to go to the meet and greet and they would resolve what was going on when we get back. As we ran frantically down the long hall for the meet greet I couldn't help but think about it the whole time as my partner and sister kept asking if everything was okay. After the meet and greet we returned to the desk when they told us we only had tickets for meet and greet and not the actual show. When I pointed out to the workers that our tickets said GA which stands for general admission and seat 27 they said that my ticket was a mistake and could not explain why it said that. They then basically embarrassed me again and said we do not have tickets for the show. It was at that time I handed the gentleman my credit card and paid an additional 700 something dollars to purchase seats for the show. Almost 4000 dollars later I wanted to cry from the embarrassment from the staff and unprofessionalism experienced. I did not want to disappoint my boyfriend or my sister. We also had to ask for our vip lanyards and posters or else we probably would of walked out without them. Sorry to give such a bad review but I felt like the zappos staff could of done better considering the situation was not my fault and considering the amount of money I spent to have a good time.

If you are bringing your dog, this place is great it's pet friendly and they don't charge to bring your dog.

anLYjbAgLYWG2FqNdQ6H7w,"I used to live closer and when I did, this was my go to mall. Overall, it is pretty easy to get in and out of the mall, since it has a circular set up. I like that it is easy to park outside the large department store where I wanted to go and then I could easily navigate to another store within the mall. Weekends are definitely the busiest days for this mall - jammed with families and teenagers. It became hard to navigate and those days I wouldn't want to go from store to store. I exclusively came for the big department stores, such as JCP, Dillard's, and Macy's. (Sears always smelled weird and I avoided it.) When smaller stores opened and closed, I didn't pay much attention to them since I wasn't that interested. I like coming here now for the Food Truck Thursdays in the parking lot.

They have small menu with all good things. We tried the pollo, asada, pork and their chiwas tacos and they were all good. They are served street taco style. Our favorites were the chiwas and the steak. There's a mini salsa bar with a couple salsa options that were both too spicy for me but that's not saying much because I can't handle too much of the hot stuff! The only thing I could see being a problem is that they're making food as ordered so there may be a little wait but, in my opinion, that's what makes it good. Fresh food is always better.

On the plus side, happy hour is decent at half price appetizers, free chips & salsa and cheap drinks. I've been here 6 times for happy hours and decided to use my Living Social deal for a dinner last weekend. 

Bad decision, my happy hour memories are ruined. Stale chips, slow and awful service and I found a hair in the free salsa and had an overall horrible experience. I used a Living Social deal for $10 for $20 and the visit solidified my decision to not go back again, not even for happy hour.

The service is awful, the hostess doesn't greet people as they enter or say goodbye as they leave...I never thought I'd notice a hostess so much until I saw how little this one did. She spent most the time picking at her nails while at the front. 

We had a party of 5 total and 3 of them came after we had already ordered our drinks. Our server never took drink orders for them and we had to grab her to order more food. 

Our food wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good. Service was horrible, but they didn't even seem that busy.

4LyM0GtkBkItIH-Tz9xWZg,"Great culinary experience!

Had lunch and was mildly disappointed at how thin the lunch menu was. I had looked over their dinner menu last night and was intrigued by about a dozen dinner menu items. The dinner lineup looked so good that I needed to explore Fin & Fino immediately. So, lunch.

Beautiful, uncrowded décor! Service that was friendly and very competent! 

Quick note; I don't get the name... Fin and Fino, what does that mean?

For lunch I selected 4 things
1. grilled Bahn Mi shrimp app, which was flat out spectacular. Served six perfectly grilled, decent sized shrimps. Cut these in half and had 12 ideally sized bites. Whatever it is they grill these things over, it gives the shrimp succulent, smoky char-grilled flavor. When you combine the pickled daikon/carrots, sriracha aioli, and popped sorghum onto your fork with a shrimp bite you'll have a nice sized, delicious bite. From start to finish, each bite was a wonderful taste treat!
2. soup of the day was shrimp gumbo. You could tell that this was a long, slow savory journey from cutting board till ending up in my bowl. Marvelous flavor, marvelous kinda-spicy seasoning, marvy aftertaste!
3. unsweet ice tea is something I'm particular about. Boom! Nailed it. brewed just right ... not sitting in a pitcher of melting ice for a long time before I ordered it ... refills were timely and delivered in a fresh glass ... Delicious Southern tea, just normal tasting, made like it's supposed to be, delicious tea!
4. half dozen raw oysters. The oyster menu is hidden in a separate menu that is really the drink menu. I never would have found them if I hadn't asked. The dinner menu is chock full of oysters. The St. Simon ones I had were elegant, sweet, wonderful looking (but undersized) oysters. Killer house-made sauce BTW! Also, Killer house-made crackers!

Main course came out quickly and it was steaming hot and fresh. One order of BBQ pork fried rice and an order of beef lo mein. I always ask for sweet n sour sauce and hot mustard, hot mustard was exceptional. 
Waitress came back several times, if she was unavailable anyone walking by would ask if we needed anything.

n9B9XWtqYy1s-nyV6qnGwQ,"My best friend and I came here to see what the hype is about. As we got closer to the restaurant, I was actually pretty surprised at how nice it look. It was in isolation from all the other stores with an open concept that allowed you to see all four floors of the building with the cafe at the very front. We got to Yorkdale at around 1 and because they don't take reservations they told us to come back in an hour. Since the cafe is in Yorkdale we decided to walk around until we got a text. After 30 minutes or so we received a text and made our way back to RH ready to dine. The seats were so spacious and not to mention they were actually super comfortable. I especially loved their marble tables. The entire cafe was just very aesthetically pleasing. 

Their menu was limited so we ended up just ordering a kale salad with a salmon plate since we weren't that hungry anyways. The kale salad was actually a Caesar salad mixed with kale and it was delicious. The salmon salad came with toast cheese and other things you could eat along with it and it was filling. The two dishes we got were perfect for sharing and surprisingly filling. 

Overall, good service and food. The price is on the costly side but the aesthetics of the cafe and the entire building itself is worth it. Don't forget to go in and take a look at their furnitures too, cause they got some pretty stuff (take the elevator because they have a little bench you can sit on LOL)",4.0
dGLp2nY8cqTQWATQARs4Sw,"Firstly, I have no recent experience dealing with this event. I realise as of 2016 the management team that used to own the show will no longer be managing Fanexpo and I have no experience with what Informa will do or what they're like.
   I went two times to the show from western Canada in 2009 and 2010. Hobbystar ran the event completely in those days. I am one of the little guys in the artists alley. I was okay with the show the first year I was there, I really had a hard time covering the cost of my table at the show, but there were like minded people I hung out with and it was a decent experience.
   What totally turned me off from the show after 2010 were a few things: (1) They ripped us off when the fire marshall locked out the buying audience, and I could not sell near as much since the buying audience was never inside for a large portion of the event  and (2) Hobbystar pretty well told me in my e-mail maybe the reason I didn't cover the cost of my table the second year is perhaps because I can't draw, while other artists were fully reimbursed (those artists have told me since then).
   That being said, I do not trust Hobbystar with running anything. As long as they are involved I keep hearing awful things about the show, and them over selling and attendees that already paid year in year out unable to get inside. And of course the blatant dishonesty they caused the artists that attended and the attendees they keep ripping off. If I suck at drawing, then why did I not have the same problem a year before? Take some responsibility for yourselves Hobbystar. Otherwise take a class in management, because you have proven to the public you can't handle the job.
   It's 2016, and Informa is creating a terrible reputation amongst artists and attendees. I have never dealt with them, but the tables are more expensive, harder to find, and a lot of exhibitors are telling me to look elsewhere. No problem, I am headed to events that treat people better, if anyone else wants to run this, I'll consider returning.",2.0

CIEXJ39ljzwst2A7NTC_8A,"They get an automatic bump to 4 stars for brazenly being the only malaysian joint in town. Despite being all over the map (sushi, chinese, malaysian, thai, japanese) Cuisine Malaya does really well (as in, authentic) with some stuff, pretty well with the rest. Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.

The lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.

All the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).

W7j0C8LZTXySIX9h3QedOA,"This was a total rip off!  My friends and I purchased the VIP Pool Party tour for $39 with TravelZoo.  It advertised 3 pools (Wet Republic at MGM, Liquid at Aria and Venus at Caesar's Palace) but it only gave access to 2 pools and one of them was where you met to get on the bus.  So literally the bus only took us to one pool and didn't even pick us back up.

We met at Liquid at the Aria.  We were there for an hour and then got on the party bus.  It stopped at the Vegas sign for a picture which wasn't advertised and none of us cared about.  My friends and I just stayed on the bus to drink while others went out for a picture.  Then it took us to a pool called Sapphire which was off of the strip and left us there.  We had to get our own way back and never saw the party bus again.  It was a total rip off for only a 10-15 minute party bus ride.  The bus had free drinks but it was premixed Cuervo/canned beer and the ride was so short we only had time to down one or two drinks before it was over.

Liquid at the Aria charged extra for chairs and wouldn't let us even put our sandals or purses down on the ground.  We had to check them.  Sapphire was off the strip and pretty empty with not much going on.  Nothing felt VIP.

C1aIhPAU0uChQT1Ksey01A,"I just finally got a chance to shop at this place for the first time since it opened. There are two reasons I didn't give this place a full five stars. One of the reasons is that it's a little bit pricier than Seafood City or Ranch 99 in the middle of town. The other reason is that it is smaller than Seafood City or Ranch 99.

One of the things that I love about this place is that it's on the Southeast side of town closer to where I live. This place is great for people who live in Henderson because we finally have a fairly large Market to shop at 4 Asian and Filipino foods. This place is just a little bit pricier than Seafood City but if you live in Henderson and don't feel like driving to the middle of town then this is a great place to go. It's also a little bit smaller but they seem to carry all of the basics.

The restaurant that they have inside is also really good. Because of the amount of traffic that seems to go through there the food seems to always be fairly fresh. I tried the Sisig, beef steak and BBQ Chicken skewer. The food was great. Although the Sisig was made a bit differently than what I'm used to it was still very good and full of flavor. I would definitely go back to try other dishes.

The one thing I was really surprised with the huge selection of ice cream. So many different flavors of ice cream like mango, Ube, Green Tea and Coconut. Next time I go I'm getting the Halo Halo ice cream.

The potato salad they served tasted exactly like the Reser's kind you get at the deli (in other words, gross).  When I asked for chips with my sandwich, they brought out Sun Chips.  Really?

NnFU11pn6M2trBIUG8WFHQ,"Since the original review for Ponte Vecchio was written, it appears that there have been some major changes to the menu.  Namely with the pricing.  Entrees range from $9 - $28 dollars, which is in line with a lot of other moderately priced restaurants. Salads and apps range from $4-$14.  

But enough about money.  

The atmosphere at Ponte Vecchio is incredible.  There is a great view of downtown Cleveland which is easily visible from the restaurant and the spacious patio.  The service is great and everyone in the restaurant seems determined to make sure you're having a great meal.  The bar area is nice and there is a great selection of wine and alcohol.

I went to a vegetarian food and wine pairing and had a phenomenal meal.  The food was great and the wine selections were perfect for each course.  I hope to go back in the near future and try something off the ""regular"" menu (which has vegetarian options - the general manager of the restaurant is a vegetarian and makes sure that there are options for her people).

The job will no doubt take at least double the time frame promised and the crew will certainly enjoy using your front lawn and patio for their ""lunch breaks"" which can run from 10am - noon and be complete with food trash, crumbs, cigarette butts and a radio so all your neighbors can enjoy the sounds of Spanish music mixed with 3-5 loud Spanish speaking men who have no idea how to paint a home.

You can even speak with the owner, a well-spoken ""business man"" whose ""professional company"" is happy to not properly do any of the job you're paying for.

U9wTGybzt1qQ8mUcvDKoPQ,"Have had some good experiences at Buffalo Wild Wings in the past but can't really recommend this place anymore due to my last experience here.

What happened?

Came on a Thursday night to watch a football game.     Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.

I sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.

  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.

Within another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.


We get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.

  Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can ""get it whenever we're ready"", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    

  At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    


 The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.         


   I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.  


I'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.     No thanks.",2.0

The next few times I visited during busier times such as the weekend was not the same. But it was also a different server.  The service depends on who is working... it's very inconsistent. 

In terms of offerings, most of the drinks are just like majority of other bubble tea chains. The one thing that makes coco unique to me is their sago topping.

Last night at 7:30 pm (5/6/13) my battery died yet again in my car. I purchased it from O'Reilly about 3 years ago an had it replaced about 14 months ago with a new battery from O'Reilly's. I took it out of my car and brought it in, expecting to have a quick check on the battery and replaced like it's always been.   To my dismay the employee said he needed to attempt to charge the faulty battery for 30 minutes while I waited in the store. I complained that this was never done ever in the past and he stated this is always how it was done.   Since the employee did not value my time over his, I was forced to wait while they attempted to charge my faulty battery. After 30 minutes he checked the battery again...and determined it was indeed faulty. He grabbed a new battery from the shelve and informed me it would be $55... I complained that the last battery did not last the 24 months and it was under replacement.   The employee informed me that the warranty was from the original date of purchase and prorated afterward. After explaining that he wasted over a half of hour of my time and other retailers such as Costco allow the warranty period to restart when you get a new replacement...he didn't seem to care. He actually told me, ""well you should of bought it at Costco then"".   At that point I took my old battery back and left the store.

For some people this is a good thing, but for those looking forward to being able to gamble and whatnot till 4AM in the morning and then take an elevator to your room to rest, try elsewhere.  Besides that though, this place is great.

My only gripe with this hotel was one involving me reserving 2 Queen/Solitaire Suite with (2) Queen Beds, but when I got there they only had the (2) suites with (1) King Bed each.  I spoke with them and called in for the pull in beds and it also helped that the couch was also a pull out too, so that served our needs.  So, all in all, wasn't a deal breaker.  

I did like the suites though for the most part, bathroom was huge, Kitchen came stocked with glasses, silverware, and small appliances, no pots or pans, but it didn't matter.  Although we didn't use it that much, it was nice to have it available to us if we did.

The place itself is located (2) blocks from the strip and is pretty easy to find from the 15 Freeway.  Get off on flamingo and keep driving down, and it will be on your right.  

All in all, not a bad hotel, just make sure you confirm A FEW times before you go there.",4.0

This place was Incredible! Came in on date night with my Husband to try something different than classic dinner & a movie. It was such a great idea! 

Low Down: Its a bit away from China Town in It's own shopping center. The outside looks a little plain and so does the decor inside. They were  quite but extremely polite.  Yes there's a bit of a language barrier. However, they were Wonderful! The rooms were dark so we didn't really get to see. Most likely because we went after dinner (please see my review about dinner @ Yojie's!!) We did the 40min manager special, full body massage. It was so relaxing and I cannot emphasize enough what a great job they did. We both had trouble staying awake. The professionalism while paying was an awesome change up from everywhere in the city where tips are ""expected."" We tipped well because they most certainly deserved it.

The food was cooked well enough and tasted fresh, though the rosemary potatoes were cold and not very good both times I went.  Highly recommend the Cafe Caramel Coffee, incredible.  

Short of that, everything else lacked the wow factor or really great overall flavor.  They seemed to play it safe across the menu.  Even the pancakes were a little bland.

One big platter with the eggs, meat, potatoes and toast came first.  We were already shocked by the food portion we completely forgot about the second giant plate that came with the pancake and French toast sprinkled with lots of cinnamon.  We obviously couldn't finish our food.  We are two little Asian girls that have a big appetite but this was definitely out of our league.

The perfume scent that others complain about in their reviews, actually wasn't bad...I was worried about it, being highly allergic to strong smelling perfumes, but it was actually really nice...I even miss it now...I didn't sneeze at all from it. We arrived early, 2pm, and they checked is in no problem (3pm is checkin)...Our room was very-very nice, my hubby's jaw sort of dropped when he first saw the room (I booked the whole thing so I already saw the pictures). It was very spacious, from the bathroom to the bedroom/living room...3 TVs in the place! I subtracted a star though b/c our TV in the bathroom did not work :( I was bummed b/c being a woman I spend a LOTTA time in there :)

My hubby walked by it and said it was nothing major, so I believed him. There were sufficient chairs at the pool, and the waitresses came by occasionally to see if anyone needed drinks. They could've made more money personally if they came by more frequently.

We took a bus tour from Las Vegas - a mistake recounted in my review of the tour company elsewhere, but our Groupons were a gift, so I am thankful that they got us to this wonderful place.  The bus tour was mainly a mistake because I wanted more than the 2.5 hours allotted for our visit and the shorter Power Plant tour.  Next time we will drive ourselves, get the requisite reservations and background checks for the longest tour and have time to see the exhibit museums.  There are also trails in the area, one through the old railroad tunnels visible from the Lake Mead overlook.  If you don't have much time, I believe your only cost to walk the Bridge and Dam will be parking in the structure next to the Dam.  There are many informational plaques on the Dam walk, too, and the Art Deco work is an inspiration.

As with most arcades the games are all in rows. And there aren't JUST pinball machines there is Ms. Pac-Man, The Simpsons, a super old goalie game, shooting games, air hockey, and Zoltan! The games were grouped together by type of game, I loved the organization. There were different pinball machines sprinkled throughout the rows, besides the two/three full rows of pinballs. And I appreciate the cards with all of the info on each of the games such as what year the machine was made, how many were made and which machine that particular one is, perhaps having them typed up would make them more noticeable? 

My favorite pinball machines were The Flintstones, Twilight Zone, and Shaq(I made a basket!)

There's an area blocked off from the games with a drink/frozen food machine and a 25cent popcorn machine. Food machine was out of order. I noticed there is a microwave!

Service was super friendly and fast!! And of course everyone loved Eegee's at work.. I feel like we have the same baked goods every potluck and it's 107 today in phx and a nice cold Eegee's is a definite must when it's that hot!!

When you ask them for a napkin to clean the table they are more then happy to give you one and I mean only one piece.  Tell them its to do their job and they might give you 2 pieces.

Anyhoo, lets get straight to the food.  It is really good especially the half chicken Tandoori without rice.  If you get rice they charge you an extra $2.00 and that's not worth it.

r9IzM-e7R1ipcA0MRAzuXw,"In a city without much green grass- this park is an oasis. There is an area for horseshoes, volleyball, bbqs, a large play area for kids, and the bathrooms are  centrally located. There is a sidewalk all around the perimeter which is great to explore the park. If you are feeling adventurous and are wearing a good pair of tennis shoes- then venture up to the top of the peak for a 365' view of our beautiful city. 
My only gripe is that the lawn is usually damp and some places even have puddles. I have been there mid-day when the sprinklers come on and spray all over the sidewalk. 
Dogs are allowed as long as leashed. 
Also, there are only a few trees so be aware during hot weather-bring a hat and some water.

gIw7BRxpoJp3ac8PirBNcA,"I have a 840 sq ft place here (now 13 months),  it is two bedroom and two bath.  When I was shown the apartment the lack of lighting in the living room or either bedroom was not pointed out to me as I believe it should have been.  That is just the start.  The rent it turns out is $300 or more for a comparable apartment in the area.  When I moved here I was under a serious time crunch and basically had to find a place faster than I would like.  The staff in this place are always very nice and very helpful.  I have never had an issue with any of them.  Most of the common areas, at least on the first floor, are extremely clean.  The halls on my level level 4 are dirty and stained.  I believe this to be because few people see my level and therefore they are not as concerned as they are with the more visible areas on the ground floor.  Also on this note the hall areas are concrete, on ground level the concrete is glazed or coated, level 4 has bare concrete so it stains and show dirt and grime very easily.  I like that the gates are actually in working order and used at all times of the day and night.  I do not like that the expensive track lighting bulbs that I am forced to accept as the provided light in the kitchen and the dining room (remember the living room and bedrooms have no lighting)are not provided by the complex.  The parking spaces are tint!!!!!  Overall the apartments are very nice but over priced by at least $200 if not $400 per month.  Look else where and you will find similar places at much more reasonable prices.",2.0

I ended up ordering the 16 oz dark roast while my girlfriend had a 16 oz iced tea.  Almost $8, ouch, but it is Vegas.  The coffee was strong but not particularly good and the iced tea was just decent.  I feel like I probably could have had better coffee playing the slots.

Our drinks were good, but expensive. $24.50 for a Bloody Mary...Vegas prices!?!  Whatever.  The bottomless mimosas were just as expected.  The best part was the to-go cups with a fresh mimosa. 

The food.... well, I ordered the Huevos Benedictito, a Spanish version of eggs Benedict.  Great in concept, but not execution.  The English muffin was tough and burnt, the carnitas was hard (how do you get meat hard & dry...too much time under the warming lamp perhaps), but the eggs and sauce were tasty.  At least there was something redeeming about the plate.  And don't even think about getting the hash browns unless you want some undercooked and not seasoned potato strings.  (I think they were potatoes?) They were bland and blended into the plate. My hubby ordered the Beach Bum omelette which looked good and full of veggies. He said it was okay, but he had the same lifeless pile of cardboard shoestring things they called hash browns.

i2qarRDlhb0dUgSaNylyNQ,"Milestones on Highway 7 and Yonge used to be a Japanese restaurant and before that an Outback Steakhouse. Those businesses we quite unsuccessful. I'm thinking it's based on the location. One thing that Milestones did well was create a beautiful patio. With their daily drink specials they should do relatively well in the summertime.

So we want to Milestones on a Thursday evening and once we arrived there were no more tables available in the patio. We dined in the dining room. Our server who we won't name, wasn't that great of a server, not to us anyways. We first received our waters and my glass had black particles in water so I got a replacement. She was not giving us much attention. The experience that she was providing to us was not very engaging. As much as I pushed to initiate conversation she was not very interested in making small talk. When we received our food and started eating she did not once ask how our food was or if there was anything else we needed. Being a server in the past, I know that's the basics of what u should be asking. 

As for the food that we ordered it was pretty good. The Stacked Burger I ordered was great along with the redskin fries. Only issue I had was the portion of fries that I received, it looked like someone in the kitchen ate half my fries before serving it. Also in my opinion the burger should have been on a different plate as the width of the plate was too short and when I ate the burger the toppings were falling off the plate. There were no complaints about the Pesto Chicken Penne Asiago. It was a good pasta dish. Overall with a little better customer service this place could have great potential. Jimstar Out!!",2.0

NMMwWm27WxYz9EVpq0aV-g,"The place is absolutely gorgeous, yes.  Nothing you'd ever expect to see in Vaughan. My friends and I got here around 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon and the place was quite busy.  All the tables were taken but luckily one cleared as we were done placing our order.  Seating is on a first come first serve basis, so it's best to try and find a seat before ordering.  The table we got was right by the window and for some reason the window was open and it was 1 degree outside.  I had to keep my jacket on.

The 3 of us ordered the snickerdoodle cupcake and my one girlfriend got the coconut cupcake.  I also ordered a jasmine tea and my girlfriends got a smoothie and macchiato.  None of us were a fan of the cupcakes.  The icing was way too sweet.  We couldn't finish it.  It is perhaps because it is a vegan cupcake, but the cake was a bit hard.  It was edible, but just not what I am used to.  The tea and macchiato were delicious.  

Probably won't come back as this was a far trip for us and we weren't too crazy about what we got. I didn't feel too hot after eating all that icing.  It is a great place for pictures though and a place to meet your girlfriends. There is also a private room, which is probably another experience in itself.  Great for larger parties.",3.0

While the presentation of the restaurant is great when you walk in, it's def nicely decorated and kitschy since it's adjacent to a gas station, I'm not sure what everyone is raving about as far as the food.

Unsure of the portions we decided to split the cheeseburger and brisket sandwich. There wasn't really anything special about it as we found the brisket tough to chew and the cheeseburger just ordinary and nothing to write home about. If you order the brisket even sliced I felt I had to saw the brisket into small easy pieces to swallow and this is a task as you only have plastic utensils to do it and in a small basket. While there was a little BBQ sauce bar by the drink section, I believe that good BBQ and brisket doesn't need to be smothered in sauce to taste good. The only thing we didn't try and maybe it could of upgraded our experience was something from the dessert case. Nice and clean establishment but I've had much better.",2.0

gq96eVIx4tvRxtIjJL7-KA,"I want to say that the customer service I received from Stephanie was fantastic.  But other than that I can't say the rest of my experience was as great as she was.  I went here for the first time because I needed some hair supplies and my hair dryer broke on me and I was in a rush to get a replacement.  I've heard of Sally's before so I decided I'd check it out.  I came to this particular location and found everything I was looking for including my hair dryer.  The day after, I went back to get an exchange for a hair razor because I purchased the wrong one.  No problem there, as it was a straight exchange.  A couple of days later, I tried to use my NEW hair dryer and it broke down after 2 uses... It was no longer blowing hot air.  WTF.. So I made a second trip to go exchange it for another one.  I exchanged a hair dryer that was cheaper than the original one I purchased and I was supposed to get a REFUND on the remaining balance, but instead the girl did a PURCHASE and charged me for the difference.  I didn't realize this until my bill came in the mail saying I did purchase rather than a return.  Annoyed, I went to the store a couple weeks later with my credit card bill asking to speak to the manager on duty about this.  Stephanie, the supervisor on duty, called her manager right away and took down my information, informing me that the manager would call me the following Monday when she was in.  Monday rolled around and I never received a call, I called on Tuesday and the girl told me that she never came in for her shift and that she'd pass along the message to call me back asap.  A week later, no call.  At this point, I'm irritated and angry with the horrible customer service, especially from the manager.  I went straight to Head Office and called them to inform them of the issue and what was going on.  The process of having to refund my money onto my credit card should not take over a month!  I spoke to a representative from Head Office and she said she would have to speak to the store and look further into the situation and she'd call me back.  A couple more days pass by, no call.  I decided I'd call Head Office AGAIN.  I spoke to a representative and she said that the manager was dealing with another customer and she would get her to call me back as soon as she was done instead of putting me on hold.  I was very stern and straight forward informing her that I would be really upset if she doesn't call back and she insisted she would let her manager know before she leaves for the day.  Never received a call within the next 15 minutes. I called back again, and got another representative  and told her that the manager on duty was supposed to call me back.  She went to go look for the manager and she had already left for the day!  At that point, I was livid and I expressed how I felt to the representative I was currently speaking to and she was EXTREMELY RUDE and interrupted me as I was speaking!  She even responded with ""Do you want a solution to this?..... Fant-astic!"" (In the most sarcastic voice ever).  She asked me to call my bank to ask them to reverse the charges and to let them know I didn't approve of it.  So basically after waiting a month to get this sorted out, she wanted me to solve it on my own.  How f'ed up is that?  The next day - of course, I receive a call from the store and from Head Office again.  Both of them left a voicemail stating that they would do the refund without any issues as long as I go into the store to do it..  SERIOUSLY?  I have to make another trip to the store to do a refund??  I called Stephanie to ask her if we could do the refund over the phone and she asked her manager and the manager said no because they needed my physical card to do the refund.   So now this was going to be my fourth trip to the store.. and that will be the last time I go back to the store, PERIOD.  In fact, I'm done with Sally's Beauty all together and I wish I had never purchased their $5 membership.",1.0

My usual restaurant was closed for some reason so I thought I'd try something new.  I read the reviews on just-eat and other than comments about delivery times it had good reviews so I gave it a try.  Big mistake. 

Here's the rundown of my order.

General Tao chicken - cold, over cooked with next to no sauce to mask it's horrible flavor. Had a few pieces and the rest went to the trash. 

Sushi pizza (white tune) - where's the fish?  Most pathetic looking sushi pizza I've seen. The fish was paper thin and flakey.  I questioned if I should eat it but I was starving so stomach won. 

Snow dragon roll -  this also had white tuna. Same situation as above. 

Buffalo roll - this one I actually liked.  Would have been better if I could have seen or tasted some of the cream cheese that was listed as an ingredient but at least it wasn't as horrible as the rest of my order.

0Fo6TXGUVh5c_8YTaAQJYQ,"I appreciate that Let's Take a Seat is the only restaurant I know in the Champaign-area (thus far) that dares 
1) to be bold 
2) twist the ingredients of traditional dishes to create ""signature"" dishes
3) caters to vegetarians with meat substitutes like seitan (which I enjoy even if I'm not vegetarian).

Location:
Let's Take a Seat is located by Jupiter's Too. Unfortunately, it is quite far from where I live so I've only been there once. Free lot parking.

Ambiance:
You can tell post-docs and professors go here based on the caliber of conversation (that may include criticizing students for being whiny). I find it pleasant, and generally pretty quiet. When I went in late August, there were ample tables, black chairs and gray carpet. Overall, it was a bit drab and dim for a Thai place. They also seem to have a mini stage which makes me wonder if this place offers, or its prior owners, offered karaoke. The lighting was a little dim for my taste too, but it is okay. It's decent for a romantic date.

Food:
- It's rare to screw up thai iced tea so well-done.
- I ordered the peanut egg foo young because it was such a unique concept. It is not the most favorite thing I have had in my life because I overdosed on the Thai peanut sauce. Think about it: two thick, juicy omelettes, soaked in super sweet thai peanut sauce. It was hard to get through one because it was so rich. However, it was worth trying and I do like this restaurant's boldness in trying new things.
- Wait, they had dessert? And it looks as good as what the pictures show?! I have to go back...

Shrimp fried rice: it's nearly impossible to mess up fried rice unless you tried really hard. In this case, you would dishona our famiry!!! The shrimp is big and not the small wimpy dried ones a lot of the other places give. Can't go wrong if you want a rice dish.

Roasted duck: the skin is gooey, not crispy as I want it. There is very little meat on it. I was a bit disappointed in this one..

Chow fun (dry): this dish is like Asian spaghetti. I like the fresh sprouts that they use and the noodles are always delicious.

Here's what we ordered (all in the large size)...

cheesesteak sandwich:  way too rich and ""Velveeta cheesy"" for our taste 

meatball sub:  it was okay, the marinara was the best part

fettucini alfredo w/ chicken:  bland sauce

calzone:  honestly can't give a review of this other than it was humongous!  it came out later than our other food, so we were too stuffed with the other dishes, that we just gave the entire thing to the valet attendant at our resort.",3.0
Ln0FJfPMKsXsZrTrcki7iQ,"The service Felecia provided was phenomenal. She took her time to explain the menu and was prompt with our drinks and food order. Now on to the food....YUM!!! We shared the biscuits and gravy and a side of Mac and cheese. The biscuits are on the top five of our favorite! It was light, but flavorful. To top it off they give a chicken thigh that was amazing. The Mac and Cheese was to die for. Creamy, cheesy and a bit of a crunch. If you like good southern cooking and a laid back atmosphere definitely check this place out!!",5.0
CfljhXe9XNHcomIzuPX9EA,"I don't think I've given a 5 star review in a mighty long time but my goodness I LOVE this place!! I've been twice. It was love at first bite but I didn't want to be deceived so I decided to give it another try before writing my 5 star review. 

The first time I dined here I had the Quad City Melt and the soup of the moment. Delicious! The Quad City Melt was soooooo good. I stopped in today for lunch and ordered the Fall Leaves salad with red onions and dried cranberries. Holy crap!! Try it!! 

Happy hour is served daily from 11am - 6pm. Do not skip the red sangrias and the peach Margaritas, by far some of the best. $6.50 a pop, regularly priced at 7.50 and 8.50.

They feature a lunch combo (1/2 salad and 1/2 pasta, 1/2 salad and soup but you can't order a half sandwich and half salad). That's the only bummer for me, besides that. It's by far one of my favorite spots for lunch!! Oh ... if you want to add chicken to your salad know that it's baked, no or grilled. I'm not big on meat in my salad but if I do I prefer it's grilled",5.0

So as I'm paying an Uber driver to sit and wait, 10 minutes later(for 2 damn sushi burritos), I finally get my order. 3 people behind the counter and 2 of them stood and watched as the 3rd, and very apparent brand new person, struggled to put together the order.

To make the most of your Vegas experience and somehow save some money during the day so you can obviously spend twice as much at night, the Buffet at the Bellagio is the answer. After you wake up with ample time to recover from your hangover, find your way to the line here and get here at 3PM. You'll get in about 30 minutes while they're still serving lunch. Grab a small plate to sample anything from the lunch entrees that look unique. This is your appetizer. Now, wait until 4PM for them to put out the crab legs, seafood, and dinner entrees. Your first and last meal of the day is now ready. With this strategy, you just got to taste the lunch AND dinner items for the lunch price ($25). I went with a large group of Asian people so we had this strategy down long before we got here.

a7WhqcCRIfkheJbg_aE52Q,"A little disappointed that Blue Wasabi was closed (on a Friday afternoon-WTF...), the next place to grab something to eat was Cantina Laredo.

Place was a bit empty, but had a very clean and modern feel to it. The waitress was promt and was nice, she explained the ingredients in both the hot and cold salsa that came with the chips. It's nice that their chips and salsa are complimentary. Chips feel really light and airy, with a crisp in every bite. Salsa is not the regular chunky red stuff that you'll find at El Torito and On the Border, it's a brown, roasted, smokey sauce. Very different and pretty tastey.

I had the Tacos Al Pastor (Four corn tortillas with roasted, cascabel marinated pork), and she made sure to tell me that they were spicy. And were they!! Meat was a little on the dry side, but had plenty of dry, hot spice. I also had the side of refried beans and rice. They also made very sure that my cup of water was never empty. Spent around $12+Tip, so it pretty average price for 'gourmet mexican food'.

rL4_1bFh0Vh1DpEIaxg4Uw,"When I first moved in here two years ago when P.B. Bell managed, the office staff was super friendly and I felt it was worth the price. Now that Escape is under new management, I can't say the same. The grounds used to be clean and office staff was friendly. I transferred from a one bedroom apartment to a two bedroom within the community a year ago. Upon inspection, the maintenance crew told me I would not be charged. The carpet was pulled up and frayed near a bedroom door and one wall had two large holes from a TV wall mount. Even still, I was told it was fine and that the carpet would have to be replaced anyway and touch ups are done before new residents move in. In the present, my lease just ended and an inspection had to be done by the new management crew. First off, Brenden was extremely rude to me while doing the inspection. He told me it was not normal wear and tear and would be at least 200 dollars to patch up the carpet. The ""damages"" in the second apartment are not as bad as the first. The only reason I did not fix the TV holes on wall and rug, is because I was not charged last time. Every time I tried to reason with Brandon he raised his voice at me and said there is no use talking to me I don't get it. I recently spoke to the manager Chris Carrol and it was as if I was speaking to Brendens twin. He even tried to charge me 55 for the touch up paint for the two holes on wall when Brenden said it would only be 20. He also stated that they are good friends outside of work and said that I shouldn't have made smart alec comments to Brenden. Overall, this has been a nightmare. I would not recommend these apartments to anyone and it is not worth the price. Not by a long shot. Beware the greedy management crew!!!

I guess my biggest complaint was the fact that the shipping was about $20 for my package...wouldn't normally complain but I want to say that something fishy was going on with there pricing I think they over charged me, when I got home to add the tracking # eBay said it should of only cost about $14 to ship the item via UPS based of the dimensions and the weight.

Told him we needed minute... Waited forever for him to come back, ordered. Poor prefer included three phos with no onion.

Three with NO onions."" 7 minutes later, half our phos come out.... the three non onions had to wait another 7 minutes...
And it had plenty of onions on top and inside when it finally did decide to make an appearance. Wow.

We were warmly greeted by our host, and seated by a window, which we had requested. Our waiter was extremely welcoming and explained how the menu worked. After receiving some delicious French bread and a jar of small cornichon pickles, we ordered the raclette for two, and a kid's fondue meal for our child, who was very excited to have gazpacho with it as well.
The German Beer soup I got as an appetizer was delicious and a heartier version of French Onion soup.
My husband had the scallop app, which was a thinly sliced raw carpaccio, very fresh and mild tasting.
For the main course, we were presented with a burner box and small square tray for melting the cheese. On top of the box were two small square dishes containing quartered boiled potatoes in one dish and sautéed mushrooms, red peppers and asparagus pieces, as well as a large plate of the cheese slices, thinly sliced ham, salami, dried prosciutto and a serving of a lovely green salad with thinly sliced beets on it.
My son received a smaller version of their fondue and it was perfect for him (as well as us to sample). He too received a dish with salad, some ham and veggies to dip and a basket of bread pieces as well.
We had so much fun melting our cheese and figuring out different combinations to eat our melted cheese with, and both meals were outstanding. Since we brought our own wine as well, it was even more enjoyable. The service was also excellent and attentive, with our water cups being refilled quickly (such rich food makes one thirsty, after all!).

uwMzpSbbCbbGyR5wdIAWOw,"I can't believe there is a ramen restaurant that I feel is really good and deserves more recognition/popularity. Usually I hate going to ramen restaurants due to the long lineup and the food not living up to the hype, but Koi is definitely a ramen restaurant that I will for sure to revisit and recommend. 

Environment:
The plaza is pretty easy to find and get to if you drive a car. But then again, it is super inconvenient to get anywhere if you don't own a car in Markham/Richmond Hill. There are plenty of parking at the plaza, however, it seems that there are more cars now due to the new hot pot place that recently opened, but there are still loads of parking space at the back. 
The restaurant itself is pretty small though, best for a casual dine-out for groups of 4 and under. 

Food:
Since this is a ramen restaurant it's no brainer that you must try their ramen dishes. Me and my friend both decided to order the Hokkaido Ramen (about $10) plus a Deep Fried Pork Cutlet (about $5) on the side, just in case there wasn't enough toppings in the ramen. The ramen ended up being really filling though, and for the toppings there was 1 egg, 2 slices of bbq pork, 1 small slice of fish ball, some corn, black fungus, green onion, and a strip of seaweed in the bowl. The soup was really nice and creamy, and it was relieving to see that there was no MSG in it since I didn't get super thirsty after the meal. The Pork Cutlet wasn't that good in my opinion and the batter is a little too thick. If you feel that you won't be full from the ramen you should just add extra pork to the noodle as opposed to order side dishes.  
They also have tofu cheesecake for $4 a slice, but I was already too full after my meal to give it a try. The alcohol menu was pretty large as well and they have some other interesting Japanese beverages.

PQMYitLBJoBo8IwQb2OpRA,"If you work in the Finical District, I am 100% sure you have seen HUGE lineups outside this place call Soup Nutsy. This soup fast food chain is only available in downtown and they are scattered around all the Financial District food courts.

All the Soup Nutsy serve the same type of soup with different daily soup specials, but whoever decided to introduce Wrap/Sandwich Soup combo was a GENIUS!  This place previously only serves Soups and one medium soup that comes with two sides (bread, veggies or fruits) will cost you around $10.  Their NEW Wrap/Sandwich Combo with a combo size soup (one size smaller than small) is also around $10 and you can always upsize the soup to the next size for $1 per size higher.  Doing the math, I strongly think the Wrap/Sandwich Soup combo is more worth it!

Their soup has always been good and I was surprised how good their wraps and sandwiches are also.  I personally prefer the Wrap especially the Mediterranean Lobster Wrap over their sandwiches because the breads they use are HARD.  Combo the wrap with a small Lobster Bisque, Jamaican Crab Bisque, Clam Chowder or Cream of Mushroom and you have yourself a legit meal in downtown core for around $10.

If you want to skip the line AND be able to choose whatever sandwiches/wraps and soup you want, make sure you are here around 1145am.  With all the overpriced healthy food or the greasy/fatty Greek and Chinese food within the PATH, 2 meals a week from Soup Nutsy could be a very decent option.",4.0

I prefer a crust that is on the thinner side, not too soft and not too many toppings that you can't taste the deliciousness of the actual pizza dough. I usually stick to Napoletana (Montreal Little Italy) for thin crust and Taglio di Roma (Laval) for pizza al taglio. 
Anyways, I went to Arthur Nosh, next to Adamo, to pick up pancakes for my mother. I decided to give Adamo a try. I had the rapini and ricotta slice and the fior di latte and basil slice. Absolutely fantastic. I know I will be a regular... at least when I am in the area.

YDe0DJ9zkrKOJtwKb48I0w,"It may not be the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton but I'm judging this hotel on value.  I booked through Orbitz and used a coupon that I found on another site and I managed to get a roundtrip ticket from New York to Toronto plus 4 nights at this hotel for the inclusive price of $400.  I've never paid less than $250 for a plane ticket to Toronto (and that was in the dead of winter--I traveled in the summer) so 150 divided by 4 is just less than $40 per night.  And that is only IF the plane ticket was $250.  Before writing this review, I did a search on this hotel to see what the prices are now and it's around $250 per night.  Now tell me I didn't get the deal of a lifetime.

This hotel is located downtown in a great area within walking distance to the Theatre District, Nightclub District and the many great restaurants that line King St. West.  You will find that you're amongst the finer boutique hotels.

The staff are extremely friendly and service is always given with a smile.  If you need anything, they'll attend to it right away.  The rooms are like corporate apartments with full kitchens.  I love having a kitchen in my hotel room.  Most of the time I don't use it, but this time I did.  I cooked all week and still managed to dine out every day.  It was good for my late night cravings.

My room had a king-size bed, living room area with (I believe) a sofabed, computer desk, dinette set and, surprisingly, cool decor.  The bed was amazingly comfortable and the linens weren't cheap.  The wireless internet was fast and FREE!  And there was a free breakfast buffet in the morning.  Talk about value!

If I had to pay $250/night for this place, I could probably justify it but I'm a bargain hunter and would rather pay $250/night for a $500/night hotel.  However, if I ever find another deal like the one I got here, I'd jump at the opportunity in a second!",5.0

SG0pRq44nTg57Ovl20mxBA,"I would give this place 3 stars based on tonight, but given that I've been here before, overall i think this place is a solid 4. We were originally guna spend the night at The Rail (but tho my friends called in advance for a reservation, were told not necessary, but yet when we arrived there were no tables) so after a call to Robbie's (which was also booked solid) we called Maddie's and got reservations for 8 ppl at 6:30pm on a Saturday night (week before Christmas). We were seated quickly but several other tables arrived almost simultaneously and we were asked to wait very respectfully by our awesome waiter Eric several times before our orders were actually taken (we didn't mind we were enjoying each other's company). The fun thing about Maddies is 1- you get to go pick ur own bottle of wine (which are of above-average prices) and 2- if you're a smoker: u get to smoke indoors. So getting on with it, service my gawd: amazing !! Last time me and t friends were served by Jeff (we loved Jeff he was a super awesome waiter no longer there -- if u know where he's gone please message me 'cuz we will go there!) This time we had Eric who was fantastic and soooooo charming! (And handsome ;) ) What an excellent waiter: he did awesome considering he was dealing with a staff, restaurant and stock that had had an unexpected surplus of clientele the previous night that had all but obliterated the quantity available of wines and foods making his job as a waiter most precarious. He didn't charge us for most of our sides and bought us a round of shots at the end, in return we tipped him quite merry Christmas generously but he did well in what he did because had it not been for him this place would have easily scored 2 stars tonight and we likely would never re-consider it for future outings despite having greatly enjoyed our last visit because of their lack of staff and lack of supplies making this visit so close to disastrous it was ONLY SAVED BY OUR WAITER- I cannot emphasize that enough. I had the Rib Roast beef, i ordered medium rare, it was a tad more on the rare side but i didn't complain because it was still phenomenal. Most of my friends who ordered beef of some cut had the same problem slightly more rare than medium rare, slightly more medium rare than medium but we all still enjoyed our plates. The carrots were unfortunately way under-cooked though and i did let them know. Overall our meal took 2.5 hours but we enjoyed it thoroughly. We will still be going back to this place again.",4.0
6Ope3tzPSKRiC5w5TQb9Mw,"P.J. Clarke's opened tonight in the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  Our regular Friday Night gang met there last night for the last of their ""soft openings.""  In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was comped, and was mostly limited to the evening's featured ""softie"" - burgers.  I say mostly, because when we got there, late, victims of the traffic that engulfed the Strip due to the influx of CES tourists, our friends were already gorging on a plate of raw oysters, and that wasn't on the list we were given.   We, too, were coming from the Convention center, and it took us 45 minutes to get to Caesar's, then another 10 to get the car valet'd, since that, too, was full.

Hubster and I don't eat oysters, so our friends managed to convince them to bring us shrimp.  And gawd, those were the biggest damned shrimp I've ever seen.  They were terrific.

The real freebie consisted of wine or beer, burgers, fries, and salad.  We're white wine drinkers, and there was no Riesling, just Chardonnay and Pino Grigio.  The Pino was super dry, so I had some Merlot.  The salad was one big disappointment, just a pile of ugly greens with a few thin slices of the tiniest baby radish I ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won't get you anything else, not even a crouton.

The burgers were great - fresh, meaty, not oversalted - but the buns were just ordinary.  I ordered mine with Vermont cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms.  Toppings are $1.20 each, so that brought the burger close to $14, which I guess is par for the Strip, which is why we stick mostly local.  I also ordered a cup of coffee, and it was cold.

What really drowned this place for us, though, was the water, pun intended.  The waiter asked whether we all wanted water.  I said ""no,"" but got it anyway.  It was served in small glasses slightly larger than juice glasses, with no logo.  There was no brand to approve, no cork to sniff, no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when we got the pretend bill, we noticed that THEY CHARGED FOR THE WATER!!!  What the hell are they thinking???  Has Lake Mead become a designer label??  And that, dear reader, is my death knell for this restaurant.

The service was spotty.  The place wasn't more than one-third full, yet our waiter had some trouble keeping up and getting things right.  Service picked up tremendously when Marty, who said he was a busser, joined the team.  A young and earnest full-time Type A, he went over and above to see that we were satisfied.  He was definitely worth the price of admission.

P.J. Clarke's is a venerable New York institution, in business since 1884, and that's no typo.  They're suddenly pushing to go national - they have a branch in Chicago, one that just opened in D.C., and now, Vegas.  I tried to check the website to see what the full menu is like, but the links on the Vegas page aren't working, at least on Firefox and Chrome.  (I don't go near IE).  IMHO, this is symbolic of the lengths they'll need to travel to distinguish themselves from all the competition in this town.

After travelling roughly a year to go from Calgary's NW to the deep, deep south and questioning many times if I was even still in Calgary anymore (shockingly I was), I met up with some friends to watch a Flames game here. I've been to Brewsters several times up north (Crowfoot Location) and to be honest the service has always been underwhelming. So has the food. In fact, if I wasn't a beer drinker who also likes antioxidants (they've got a killer blueberry beer here) I'd probably never go out of my way to get to a Brewsters.

But this location won me over with a combination of super friendly staff and a kitchen that seems to actually kind-of, sort-of give a damn whether your meal sucks or not. 

The place was packed, so myself and four friends lined the bar where we could see the game. Lots of screens, so this wasn't too hard.

The bartender took care of us immediately, shooting us menus and pouring drinks like we had raging infernos in our throats that could only be doused out by delicious beer. After spending a few periods here watching the game we were treated to a beer fusion - the bartender poured us all shots of a Huckleberry/Raspberry beer combo. Now, while I'm sure giving us these tiny beers was just a marketing tactic to make us buy more big beers, it WORKED. As soon as that magical Huck/Rasp elixir hit my lips I needed more of it in my life.

And that's something they don't really tell you at Brewsters - you can COMBINE the beers. They should really list that on the menu somewhere - my frankenbeer was amazing.

I ordered a burger. Normally the burgers I've been served at Brewsters have been sloppily put together and pretty greasy. Not so in the magical land of McKenzie Towne. Here my burger was immaculately composed, and while still a little drippy it was far from the messes I've been served in the past.

Our bartender kept the drinks coming with a smile on her face and despite a room brimming with thirsty guests still found a way to keep our glasses full.

My fkight was supposed to take off at 0700 and it is now 1146. First they move gates, then the plane they move us too has a flat tire, which they find on a preflight inspection 20min before boarding? I'm in the airforce, we complete these checks at least 2hrs prior to flight. Then the Nav CDU craps out then they get an engine indication light. They remove and board us 3 times then ground the plane. They still dont know when or if we will get a flight out. They give us meal vouchers to use in airport, of after you get your voucher it says in the fine print that by accpeting the voucher you cant lay anymore claim to the airline. Fooled you. This airline is a joke, their planes are garbage and in top of everything else I missed my grandmother's funeral. Thanks",1.0

p9q0wY1MdvBALUBeWPvPDg,"Finally! This review is LONG overdue - during the last year or so working downtown has given me multiple chances to eat at the beloved Bluebird Kitchen. I've come here for made-to-order breakfasts and lunches alike, and nothing has disappointed. 

Their enormous breakfast sandwiches and fresh fruit smoothies leave me feeling full and satisfied, moreso than other places with similar breakfast options; the potato, sausage, egg and goat cheese laden frittata sandwich is a definite favorite. And their lunches are also a wonderful and tasty option should I forget to bring something to work that day. Their roast beef and Cuban sandwiches have been my favorites so far.

If you're the type who likes seasonal items, Bluebird offers monthly smoothies and sandwiches as an addition to the standard menu. I tried their special vegetarian sandwich from last summer (with fried green tomato, grapefruit & cabbage coleslaw) - I admittedly remember that sandwich being on the bitter side, more so than I expected as someone who likes both green tomatoes and grapefruit. It wasn't bad though, and it was certainly a unique flavor profile compared to what I typically find for a quicker downtown lunchtime option.

It's definitely safe to say that this place has knocked it out of the park and made my taste buds very happy time and time again. And that's just considering their main meals - the amazing desserts elevate your meal options to an entirely different level. They're good. They're really good. You should go buy one of them in addition to a sandwich. And oh: this review is based on my limited perusing of the menu - I have yet to try their biscuits, granola, quiche, bread pudding, and salads.

I know getting to Bluebird before they close can be a chore if you're not nearby, but they're worth it. Stop in and enjoy!",5.0

Ok so the food pre meets the expectations of the photos i viewed prior to dining here tonight. The fries were so good that I honestly wasn't as hungry once my burger arrived, but I still cut that sucker in half and did my best to eat every bit. I ordered the mac n cheese burger with a special request of pastrami on it. Figured I switch it up a bit and I was happy to do so. Our server was name Nick and he was FANTASTIC. Superb service for a burger joint. He made our experience that much better due to his patience and willingness to help us find the entrees we were in the mood for and we appreciate that. 

So for recommendations, here our suggestions.

Truffle fries (be carefully as the portion is super large)

Pepperoni sticks (personally liked the dip more than the sticks but the wife liked them)

Chicken wings (good and fancy not mind blowing)

Mac n cheese (overrated in my opinion or more like the outback of steakhouses kind of burger) if you like outback, you'll likely like this burger.",4.0

These people continue to over charge by registering it as fiesta potatoes and then removing the sour cream and cheese, but I am still getting charged $1.49 instead of 50 cents. My husband likes their potatoes so I end up donating them a dollar from their stupidity about 10 times a month! I'm not even exaggerating either, we frequent this location quite often. Today took the cake when it comes to common sense. They charged me once again for fiesta potatoes without removing sour cream and cheese, I said that is fine leave it and add a side of potatoes.

aOgaj4yFSZPh66j2JtE9TQ,"This is one of those places that you may feel hesitant about writing a positive review because you don't want to let the secret out. However, the secret already is because this small place gets pretty crowded from 11:30 until 1:00 later in the week. I always get my order to go because the space is just too tight for me. It's about the size of a small Subway with some stools at the bar. Some of the tables are close to the drink machine and that also happens to be where the line forms to order so that can get uncomfortable quickly. It's not really in a gas station but there is a gas station next door that has a Subway inside of it. It is in the same strip mall as that station and there is also a dry cleaners in the building.

The trick is to go after 1:00 or go earlier in the week. They are only open until 5, so dinner is not an option for most people. They have a ""Speedy Gonzalez"" special that is designed to be quick and cheap. For $5.25, you get a taco, and enchilada, beans, rice, and some tortilla chips. I always get the burrito though. It's $6.25 and also comes with beans, rice, and chips. I once tried to get it with spinach but that was not good. It was just microwaved creamed spinach. They have a large variety on the menu but lack the vegetables that some of the chain ""Mexican"" places offer. Some items take longer to prepare such as steak, so if you are in a hurry or they are busy, they will let you know that (the woman that is always working the counter when I go is very nice).

Not too many dim sum restaurants in Toronto hires ladies pushing carts serving dim sum anymore. This is the way that it used to be... you wait and wait and hoping that your favourite dim sum will show up... and sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. For the popular items, you might have to send your boyfriend/father/brother to get them... if not you might never have a chance to have them. The ladies pushing carts might try to sell you their dim sums.. since some of them are so unpopular and it can be going around and around and still no one wants it.

Across the river, I found a home, place where not everyone may know my name, but where they all share the same obsessive love affair with the same music I do. 

After months of being coaxed into attending some shows at Pittsburgh's smaller venues for a change, I made it a point to catch the loaded line-up of Mud City Manglers, Argus, Carousel, and the headliners, Chicago's High Spirits, and it was an experience that rivaled a religious awakening. 

I must have struck up conversations with at least 5 people simply over the vintage Scorpions t-shirt I had on, and this was before I got into the concert venue itself! 

Adjacent to the the bar, the stage is anterior to the ex-storefront, meaning bands can get their equipment in and out through the back of the stage onto the sidewalk without having to navigate narrow corridors. And until the glass gets fogged up, one can watch the concert from outside, window shopping for rock if you will. 

The sound was tremendous, the camaraderie was unmatched, and the loud, sultry, voltaic fun had was staggering, all underneath a quilt of old t-shirts within a humble dive that for too long I dismissed. 

New friendships were formed, older ones reinforced, brains were rattled, spines tingled when familiar songs began their strains -- for several hours I was in my Avalon, my Valhalla, my element. 

I had a more enjoyable concert experience here than I have at ones held at much bigger, state-of-the-art facilities. No fireworks, light, fog, or stage props were necessary. 

It was Saturday night alchemy. 

It was Howlers, and I need to be here more often. A friend of mine lives just around the corner. How privileged he is...

Scrambled opts for the ""do it yourself"" approach to dining. You order your food at the counter and they'll bring it out to you. You're pretty much responsible for everything else, including silverware, sauces, napkins, and filling up your drink. Not that there's anything wrong with that approach. I'm just not exactly sure what it is that you're wanting me to provide a tip for? 

Anyway . . . 

Whatever you order, if it comes with hash browns, upgrade them to their ""scramble browns,"" which are probably one of the best creations they have. It's traditional hash browns with cheese and bacon mixed in. We order it every time - without fail!

I usually get the two eggs (scrambled w/cheese), that comes with bacon, bread, and upgraded scramble browns. My girlfriend prefers their strawberry French toast, which I've never really been all too impressed with - as it's basically just the addition of some strawberry cream cheese.

With most places, this is rarely a problem, but something was definitely off in the kitchen when we arrived 30 minutes before close. I received my order immediately, while my girlfriend never did. Apparently, they had forgotten about her. When she finally said something, I was practically finished with my plate. To top it off, the order they gave her was incorrect. Mistakes happen and they took care of us in the end, but the mishap did seem odd considering the place only had a handful of diners.

Be warned that servings here are pretty small. With what you pay in comparison to some of the other places, don't expect to take anything home.

The breakfast, although slightly overpriced and undersized, is still above average in comparison to many places in Phoenix. Maybe if I were a vegan, vegetarian, or anti-gluten, I'd rate it more highly. The dog-friendly patio is a nice addition.

It's worth a visit if nothing else.",3.0
4cOCGGAPRcJSzv5OtgLfLw,"A very streamlined process. From baggage claim in terminal 1 you exit door 10, cross a road and there were multiple busses waiting to take people to the center. All car agencies are in the one center. The lines were moving slowly but there is a kiosk available - at least with Enterprise - to the right of the queue. The gas option where you prepay for a full tank and then can return it empty was a good deal at $3.55; I saw gas later on in the city for $3.75. Once you complete at the kiosk/counter you take a short escalator ride downstairs to the garage. You walk to your selected companies location and there an employee (at least with Enterprise) walks you to car and you sign the contract. The process was a bit odd it seemed because the kiosk asked me nothing about insurance - the lady downstairs asked about that after I had already agreed on the kiosk to the payment amount. 

Return of the car was easy. The city has signs up as you get near so you know where to go. I pulled my car into one of Enterprise's three return lanes and was checked in and given a receipt in fewer than 5 minutes. You can ride the free shuttle back 7 minutes to the airport. I don't rent a car often but from when I have I can say this is one of the better set ups.",5.0

pL7xenCgyCurr-YRi6NlVA,"I am an Ubereats delivery driver.  I arrived at the restaurant at 2:48 pm and stood at the courier pickup counter.  There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  

His response to me was ""You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind"".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  

So, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  

I will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?  There's nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  There is a reason!  Corporate needs to take a look at this franchise and consider revoking the license.  Read these yelp reviews very carefully.",1.0
uOcShY2EomG8hWJ6wxgn_A,"For the price, you can't beat this Korean buffet place.  it is like $13 for lunch and $17 for dinner.  Most of the other Korean places are a bit too expensive ~ Suri is $27 (more variety) and the Mother Korean is $25.  My wife loves Korean so we try to do it once a month.  If we went more often (esp to a buffet), I probably ballon into the Michelin man.

As for the restaurant, outside, it doesn't look too appealing.  In fact, it looks like a run down shack.  The inside is like a diner setup.  Kinda long and curves around the end.  However, it was kinda cozy.

As for the service, the 4x's that we have been there, we thought the service was pretty good (granted, all 4x's, we were with a large party).  They filled your drinks and got you a scissor, forks, and napkins pretty often.  Only issue that I had was that they only allow you one scissor per table.  Kinda sucks when you have to cut alot of Gabbi and Korean Ribs.  Otherwise, service was good.  By the way, one of the things that I do like is that they regularly change your grille when it needs changing.  

As for the food, dessert looks awful.  Don't go there.  There non-meat dishes are nothing to talk about.  However, you are at a Korean buffet; so, eating meat and seafood is the key.  Their meat selection and seafood are pretty good.  Actually, I think it is comparable to other Korean restaurants in town.  Each time, I usually focus on eating the shrimp and Korean BBQ ribs.  Oooh la la.  Granted, you don't get the selection of the other restaurants, but you do get your money's worth.  Also, by the time that you are done eating, you do feel like a stuff pig.  Oink!  I guess this is one of the reasons why we come here often.

Vqm6GCDQQ33obwUHg2QGpQ,"We decided to stop in here after after a failed attempt at lunching at Mon Ami Gabi. We approached the hostess stand and it seemed as though it was painful for the three scantly clad hostesses to make any type of eye contact with us. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait for an inside table (it was a late Saturday afternoon). They take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready. Much to my surprise, we received a text about 15 minutes later and were taken to a table that had been open the entire time we were sitting in the lobby area. 

Oh well, next...it took a bit for the server to come to our table, a little longer to take the order, even longer to get our food...we spent a lot of time waiting. In our sever's defense - you could see that she had a ton of tables and was working really hard. I was totally disappointed to learn that they no longer had the Monte Cristo sandwich and got a club (very average) and chicken tenders (kind of weird/artificial tasting). The chicken tenders come with a chipotle dipping sauce that was kind of tasty. We finished our meal, paid without being offered a desert menu ($12-$15) and then ventured into the attached gift shop/candy store and decided against buying our daughter an $89 Hello Kitty backpack (it just seemed a bit overpriced). Plus the music was so loud, I am not sure that my tympanic membrane could handle another minute of it. In the end, I think we saved more than we spent, so it wasn't a total loss.",3.0

The lineups are usually insane, so I've normally walked in, and immediately walked out. I hapened to be walking by at 2pm, and it was empty enough that I thought I'd give it a try ....

 
I got the lunch 'deal' - 1/2 sandwich, small soup - i opted for the turkey BLT and mushroom soup. 

Oh, I also go the peach iced tea & 
and a butter croissant. 
 $17 later ... 

Turkey BLT - Had it on the multi grain bread. (choice of multi, whole wheat and white). The bread is cut literally over an inch thick. I'm not a bread person, so I ended up taking the top off. That's when I got to see what was really in the sandwich. 
Then when i did an internal 'oh, so sad'. :( 
1 piece of turkey bacon, cut in half to make it look like 2 pieces. An unripe slice of tomato (I took it off - unripe tomatoes are a huge peeve of mine), a piece of romaine lettuce, 2 slices of what look liked turkey cold cut (the same crap I buy at Loblaws). 

Mushroom Soup - errr YUCK? (can i say that?) 
There's a weird ... sweet (?) flavor that I just don't like. 
Had a few spoon fulls, and just couldn't stomach it. I'm sorry, it just wasn't good.

The staff is friendly, helpful, and know the products they are selling (maybe first hand, I didn't really care to ask LOL). If you are not sure about a product, or exactly what you want, they'll help you.

They got a small Mexican section too for tacos, nachos, enchiladas and burritos and so fourth pretty good! Nachos are okay not the best but decent atleast and the condiment bar to fill in your tacos or burritos is really good they even got good guacamole which is rare to find in a buffet in my opinion.

$17.99-*Tuesday Special; Steak & Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese with broccoli & mashed potato
$5.98-*Price is add-on to meal, 2 Salad Bar Buffet

We were seated and greeted right away. Our server took our order and checked on us, often. Service was good, nothing spectacular.

We then headed over to the Salad Bar. Very clean! We just recently went some where and I had major complaints about their salsa bar which was 'EW!' so it was quite refreshing to visit a place that kept up with their serve yourself thingie majig! I liked their selection of greens, iceberg, romaine, spinach and mixed greens. Dressings were OK, nothing I haven't tried before.

My steak was med-rare, hubster's was rare. It was seasoned well but one tid bit, it's a cheap cut so it tastes better cooked rare. Although my steak was still a little pink, it was really chewy, not fun for my jaw. Hubs enjoyed lobster, although a little over cooked it was still a deal! My Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese had flavor but I guess they stick the MnC under the salamander bc the lobster that was exposed was dry and chewy but the lobster within the MnC was still moist. Only thing I was disappointed in was their broccoli, it's probably the simplest item in this meal and it was way over cooked, borderline mushy.

6yU9j2AWVyDECUzEeCcWsg,"I wanted to give this hotel a higher rating I really did but there were a couple of really big downsides for me that hurt it.
First the positives....
Location : If you're in Downtown Toronto and visiting the Air Canada Centre, Rogers Centre, Hockey Hall of Fame etc you can't beat this location, we walked to Air Canada in less than 8 minutes and there are lots of things to do around this area. 

Cost : Our room ( Twin room ) cost about $190CAD for one night which I would consider in Toronto which is one of the worlds major cities in a convenient area to be good value.

Wi-Fi: Nowadays ( especially if you have a US phone and don't want to get killed in data roaming charges ) I would consider any hotel that doesn't offer free Wi-Fi to be a failure and doing their guest a disservice, I don't care if you build it into the price of the room but I don't want to get nickel and dimed with extras like Internet, the connection at Hotel Victoria was very good and all we needed was our login and it didn't cost any extra.

Now the negatives...

Parking : Nothing on-site, but really for this area I noticed thats most hotels, we found a parking garage literally around the corner where parked for a day and a half for about $30CAD, so factor that into your cost.

Room Size : This is a small, old school boutique hotel and as such the rooms are REALLY small, we had two Twin Beds which I think is the first time i've seen that in a hotel in quite some time, also the bathroom is quite small and when you turn on the light the shadow of the person in the bathroom is clear to see through the glass in the door for anyone else in the room, great if you're a couple, not so great if you're staying with a buddy if you know what I mean. Also we got into our room and our TV wasn't working, if i wasn't technically proficient and figured out how to get the signal from the cable box to the TV then I wouldn't have been able to watch TV in the room, as when I turned it on all I had was static, something that the person prepping the room should have checked. Inexcusable lack of detail.

Elevator : There is only one elevator in the building, so if its busy and you have alot of people staying then you could be waiting quite some time to get back to your floor unless you want to take the stairs.


So there you go, weigh up the pros and cons for your visit, if it were me I may look into one of the other options in the area, but if you're not sharing a room with your hairy buddy then maybe it might be a good option.",3.0

Where I use to visit the Bay for my Clinique cosmetics, they never had my colour in stock. Even Sephora didn't have it. I made a trip to Nordstrom and the awesome sales associate helped me find what I needed without a fuss and signed me up for their bonus program.

We both ordered the Chicken Saltinboca the procuttio was overlooked on my husbands and mine was burnt, the noodles and sauce were very salty. To their credit the food wait time was short. Our service was *terrible*. In the beginning I said to our server I would just like water, when we left my glass was completely empty not even ice in it and had never been refilled.

lbYUP6Xl4aBJuCxgWadTJA,"The meat jun is a solid four stars. The thinly sliced meat, covered in a nice mixture of egg batter with a bit of sweets and then cooked to tenderness.  The meat jun did not disappoint, but I can't say the same for the rest of our meal.  I'm still on the fence about their dipping sauce too.

The soon tofu, came out bubbling hot, but it was not in abundance of tofu and the soup was more runny because of lack of ingredients in this dish.  The taste wasn't too bad, good amount of spice, just lack luster overall.  

The bulgogi in my opinion is always the sweetest dish.  it's never really the best cut of meat, sometimes fatty, but then once in a while, you get lucky.  I would say, mediocre for this dish.  

The seafood pancake was not cooked to crisp at all.  The batter was too heavy, making it a mushy pancake versus a more nicely cooked, no soggy batter in your mouth feeling.  The seafood was okay, but I wouldn't order this dish again.  

The worst of it all, was the banchan sides.  The kimchi, seaweed, cucumbers were all super dry.  You can see the marinade, but it was like it was sitting there all day and just lacked the water that vegetables are suppose to have.

I definitely love Ocean's, it's as good as it gets in terms of asian supermarkets and holds its own in the reign of T&T Supermarket chains (which I still love but in certain aspects I would prefer Ocean's to T&T). I live super close in the area, which is always a plus, but notice that it gets really packed with customers - I had to wait forever to get checked out on a weekend because there were so many people!

I'm a sucker for their weekly deals... especially their fresh sushi to-go. Honestly I grab a box every week, no joke, and they're made fresh daily and definitely on-par with some sushi restaurants. When it gets later in the night, expect a discount as well! My boyfriend enjoys the fresh viet buns, and I've tried some of their dim sum which was great. I really like that they are a huge success on their fresh foods.. I know T&T had the same type of thing going on, but ironically I rarely bought fresh foods from T&T.

I think my favourite section is the BBQ section. They have fantastic deals on it and the char siu and free-range chicken deals are one of my faves - it means yummy dinners that week!

Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific. 

#1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. 

#2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. 

#3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. 

My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. 

* Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. 

* The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. 

* OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. 



It is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. 
*Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. 
* Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up. 
* Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period. 
* Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area. It is totally worth every penny.",5.0

28RbsMonfx_Ez8qpfsyLCw,"The phrase ""Guy ate here"" seems to be popping up quite a bit around the Valley.

On the hunt for some great Italian food, it's no surprise that Guy Fieri, of the Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, found La Piazza Al Forno, one of downtown Glendale's independent eateries.

If you've never been to downtown Glendale, it has a certain untouched-by-progress charm that's worth seeking out. There are antique and gift shops, historic homes and a choice of interesting places to eat.

Owned by chef Justin Piazza, La Piazza is all about comfort Italian. The menu might be small but it packs a wallop, offering a range of pizzas, pasta and a handful of salads. I went hog wild because there were so many things that I wanted to try, and at their low prices I indulged.

Might as well start with something light, like the Spinach Salad ($8), which is covered in a warm bacon vinaigrette and topped with feta cheese. The spinach was super fresh, showing the commitment to the best and newly picked ingredients. Considering the meager cost of this huge salad shared by two hefty eaters there is some serious value to be had here.

Antipasti offerings are kept simple, with only a handful of choices, but one caught my eye. I was elated with each bite of Fried Ravioli ($8.50). Breaking through the crispy pasta revealed an inside filled with a molten cheesy heaven. This come with a side of tomato sauce for dipping and once you get started with these bad boys, it's hard to stop.

Based on the name alone, anything called Spaghetti Pie ($9) is worth ordering. So I was tickled when the massive slab of baked spaghetti resembling a brick was set onto the table. Spaghetti was layered with cheese and finished with a tomato sauce cream sauce that was so satisfying. The spaghetti pie was a daily special, but from other visits it's pretty normal to see it featured.

Their pizzas are baked in a wood-burning oven. Preparation takes only a few minutes and the intense heat slightly chars and crisps the pizzas. The Italian Stallion ($16), in all of its meaty goodness, is covered with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, prosciutto and sopressata. For some, all of this meat might sound excessive, but the distribution and amount create a balance of cheese, meat and crust, making each chewy bite a pleasure.

Guy Fieri has taste you can trust, proving himself once again with La Piazza al Forno. During peak dinner hours there will be a line out the door. If you want to avoid this, go for lunch the odds are you'll be seated right away.",3.0
KFLN7mJ2-ksQhc-sJU2ntg,"At the recommendation of a coworker, I stopped by Daily Kitchen to get lunch one day last week. The parking lot was packed, but upon arrival there weren't many other people in the restaurant. One gentleman ahead of me in line, but it looked like everyone else already had their food. 

I ordered the regular DK burger with no onions, which comes with a side of sweet potato fries, and I ordered a lemonade. The lady who took my order was really friendly! So I got my rosemary vanilla lemonade (which was delicious!! A little on the sweet tasting side, but it was still really good) and sat down to wait for my order. A group of people came in after me from the nearby hospital/urgent care, and suddenly it was waaaay busy. I guess that's why I ended up waiting 25 minutes for a burger & fries. 25 minutes. For a to go order. Too long. At lunch time, I'd expect there to be a rush, so I'd staff enough people to handle it. They didn't seem like they had enough people to handle the rush. 

So anyway, after 25 minutes, I finally get my food, refill my lemonade and head back to the office. Open my order and my burger still had onions on it. I'm not allergic, but I don't really like raw onions, so it's not a huge deal, just mildly annoying. The food was really tasty... but it didn't agree with me. I'll leave it at that. 

The lemonade is delicious. The prices are good. The service was slow, but friendly. The food was good. But I ended up regretting my meal choice shortly thereafter. Not sure I'll want to come back based on that last bit.",3.0

W5cqmUz6bsT-MXi2HCBq0g,"Like many other SoCal folks that reviewed this place, as much as we wanted to like it based on the other reviews, we were left disappointed. 

The menu was good, a lot of options to choose from depending on what you feel like on that day. They have a number of stir-fried, rice and noodle dishes in addition to appetizers and salads. We saw that they had papaya salad so we were excited to give that a try since you don't see that at a lot of Thai restaurants anymore nowadays. We also got yellow curry chicken, since you can never go wrong with that! ....but we were wrong ): The curry was EXTREMELY sweet and watery, chicken was rubbery and rice was dry and not Jasmine-y. The papaya salad had a bed of lettuce on the bottom, which was so strange to me. At least they used real papaya but it was also sweet and not as flavorful as I would have liked. Usually in papaya salad you can smell/taste the different flavors like garlic, fish sauce, slight sweetness from the palm sugar and sourness from the fresh lime. The Thai tea was not too bad, you can tell it's real tea, just very creamy from all the cream they put on top. Once I asked them to add a bit more tea, it was better. 

One thing that really bothered me was the fact that everything came in disposable plates/bowls.. like super cafeteria style, or as if you're at church/temple. It didn't give that restaurant vibe. I guess I wouldn't mind if I was still in college but for the price point, I think they can invest in some dishes. Overall, I thought it was ok if that's the only Thai place you have access to. As for me, I will most likely not come back if you want my honest opinion. I'm just not a fan of one flavor, which for this place would be sweet.",2.0

Well drinks only $3.50 but couldn't taste any liquor in them at all and I had vodka & 7 so I should be easily able to taste the vodka.

Our main problem was the waiter was a total ass literally throwing an empty chip basket right on my place setting and my lemon that was in my water came flying out onto the table. No apology was made. I see every other review here is positive so maybe he was having a bad day but it was our first visit so we won't be back.",1.0
pbxgVo0gUlYw7UtOdkRx5w,"We entertained clients there.  It's a great location and certainly a trendy night spot.  I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.

Sort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.  

Personally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.

The food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.

I probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the ""trendy place to go"" and not because the food was outstanding. 

 Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  I would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop.",3.0

A8Mbrok8ZJoTIKiInrqKCw,"My friend and I went to SF last Sunday night cause Mon Amis Gabis had a huge wait. We quickly got a table outside overlooking the Bellaggio fountains. The menu is very extensive so it was a tough choice. We had the fried Macaroni appetizer, which was nice, the sauce was excellent, then he had a great salmon and I had french onion. The only minus of the experience was the entrees came out way too soon. When i was a waitress we'd ""fire"" the second course when patrons were on their last bite of appetizers. My friend's salmon was fine when the kitchen had to hold the food awhile, but my soup wasn't nice and piping hot. The waitress, Heather, was great and so was the busser (didn't get his name) The cocktails look very fun and creative, but I ultimately skipped the liquid desert. Service is great, but they need to be careful about entrees arriving too soon. Our table top was teeny, so we didn't have room for the entrees til our app plates were cleared. So, bottom line is extensive menu, great views, great backup option to Mon Amis, high quality service, but maybe a wrinkle or two in the ""back of house"" kitchen area. Again, Heather was great and I recc her, she told me her nights off are Wed and Thur.",4.0
RG3CDgiW5zn-yWhTJfhXGg,"Used to come here often and then for about a year I didn't come anymore. 

Today, after a long day at work I was driving in the area and I felt in need to have some comfort food and especially hot since today is very cold. So here I am again. 

Jade pho is still run by the same owner and the service is still handle by the same server who's demonstrated to handle the service in the same fast and efficient way. 
I had the old classic dish: house special which consist in rice noodles with beef, beef tendons, cartilages, meatballs, beef tripes all served in a delicious homemade beef broth.
The whole bowl comes as usual with the boost of cilantro, mint leafs and sprouts. 

The only downside I believe that the amount of side greens has been reduced. Not so sure why but as far as my memory can recall from my recent trip to Vietnam, the serving of herbs is usually very very generous because that's what Vietnamese love to death when they are having pho. 

Now, believe me when I say that I do understand that we are not in Vietnam here, but since before the portions of mint, cilantro and sprouts were more abundant than what I observed today, and knowing that the owner is Vietnamese, I was expecting the same quantity: no more no less. 

Overall Pho Jade is still a very good place for the quality they serve but this time I want to adjudicate only 3 stars just because I found the portion of the greens reduced.

The downtown location in the Simmons building definitely is bigger and has more options on their menu, while the one in Kensington doesn't have as much for hot food, but their bakery selection is almost the same as the one downtown.  

If you like sourdough, go here. Period. I dare to say that I (GASP) am not really a fan of sourdough, but I've had it here being used as a sandwich and omg yum. In the Kensington location, they have a sandwich of the day, 1 vegetarian and 1 meat option, same goes with pizza. It can be sometimes a hit or miss, depending on what you're looking for that day. I haven't come here often to know whether their cold salads go out in rotation, but I have a feeling they do. The duck noodle one is superb though. 

The Simmons building has more options and the backdrop for the this location is super rustic-industrial type setting. If you've been to the Simmons you'll know what I'm talking about.

With almost every meal that you order, you get a slice of their famous sourdough bread.

Not once between our placing an order and the moment I asked where are food was did anyone stop by and refill our drinks or check on us.

crab legs and shrimp cocktails were ice cold as in nearly frozen and biting ice chunks
typical buffet bacon that tastes like it was microwaved 
carving station lacked premium meats, just your typical roast beef and ham
wife said her omelet was very good
wife said pastries were hard and stale tasting
creme brule was disappointing.. the custard part was all thick and hard
they had a wood fired pizza oven that got me excited but the pizza didnt taste much different than your typical buffet pizza
was seated with a good view of the game on during NFL Sunday but only a small % of people there would be able to really see the only TV they had

Prior to moving here, we were impressed by what appeared to be a well groomed apartment community. We'd come over at various times of day and evening, to get a good feel for ""working hours"" 9a-6p, versus ""after work hours"" 6p-11p. Everything appeared fine. And we have ALWAYS been met with a warm welcome and smile. Michelle was and remains awesome in my book!! Sadly, she is leaving to pursue other opportunities (kudos for her!!) It's unfortunate for the property and tenants, because she's the personality in an office of 3 persons. Rarely a smile or warm greeting from the other two. The focus seems aimed at getting units filled and grabbing every extra dime possible than actual, genuine customer service. We had two or three simple fixes that were communicated during initial walk-through. One week later, we followed up to make sure they were received. ""SURE - we'll get to them very shortly."" After 5 weeks, we just ended up fixing the broken items ourselves. Simple fixes, but we pay a GOOD bit of MONEY to have maintenance take care of these things - right?? Isn't that how it's supposed to work???

Donuts, coffee, and resident events? Yes. Those all come a dime a dozen at any community these days. And maintenance staff is often seen consuming alcohol openly, in the parking lot.

JUZmiIkgnn9uCFB8vIcAQQ,"I love unique flavor combinations that are not overpowering.  Most of the dishes have a unique ingredient that gives it a new twist, without taking over the traditional base.  My favorite dish by far here is the Baja Ceviche.  It inspires me to make my own ceviche at home every time i have it.   A delicate blend of fish, shrimp, red onions, tomato, avocado and a fresh cilantro sauce drizzled over.   

My other favorites from prior visits are the empanadas and the sweet green mini tamales.  Last night I had the chicken poblano enchiladas.  Let me say I have been craving green enchiladas for about 6 months.  I loved the chicken filling and loved the addition of thinly sliced portobello mushrooms, corn, nopal and poblano on top,  BUT there was WAY too much Green sauce, drowning some of the awesome flavors.  Would have been much better with a drizzling of the green sauce and the addition of some melted white cheese.  After all it can't be great enchiladas without lots of cheese.   

My husband had the carnitas,  which were delicious.  Again unique ingredients added a twist,  bacon, citrus and a bed of polenta underneath.  His flour tortilla was the yummy authentic type.  

My other favorite last night was the CABO RITA, mmmmmm,  pear puree in a  margarita made with fresh lime juice and agave,  versus sweet and sour and triple sec.   One of the best margaritas I've ever had.  

Sadly the service SUCKED.  Our waitress never once came to check on us.  We had to wave her,  or the busboy down every time we needed something.  It even took 20 minutes just to get and process the check and we had to ask 3 times to move it along.   Also, sadly, when we made the reservation, they promised a pool view booth which was not available when we got there.  there was a front pool view table, which we said we would take, but it was ""reserved""  to make a big table for a future reservation.   When we left, it was occupied by another couple, not  a big table.   Being lied to doesn't make the guest feel appreciated. 

Had it not been for the service and the over abundance of green sauce, and the slight overprices,  I would rate 5 stars. The awesomeness of the Ceviche and the Margarita, raise it from 3 stars to 4.

tVCEdfZKMaROItKy7kqJYQ,"We came here with an open mind since there are many negative reviews about this place and we want to be our own judge.

Unfortunately, just like most reviewers here have experienced.  Don't waste your money and time here...go to Hot N Juicy.   Everything is better at Hot N Juicy EXCEPT their soft shell crab basket is a little better than HnJ.  

Service:  They don't seem to know what you are talking about.  We asked about the market price on one of the special crab, the answer was, ""I don't know what the price is... plus we don't have it anymore anyway"".  10 minutes later.. saw another table that came after us ordered a bunch of those crab.  Asked for a Sapporo, never came, finally came, but a different kind of beer, and said they don't have Sapporo or most of the beer on the menu.  One main dish (cajun clam) came out when we were about to finish the whole meal.  

Food: Shrimp are big...but tough texture and seemed very overcooked. Plus their items (shrimp, clams) didn't come in a bag like HnJ, so flavors aren't mixed and steamed together.  Corn and potatoes are on a separate plate with 0 flavor.  And the corn was cold in the middle like some other reviewers were saying.  

Overall, we came in with an open mind and walked away disappointed.  We want this place to be good and do well, but they didn't deliver.  Staff was friendly, but not very good at servicing people.  

The only good thing about this place is it's on restaurant.com, so we were able to save $50 off by using the certificate.  Didn't have to pay very much for the unpleasant dinner.  We will definitely NOT returning again and will continue to go back to our favorite still ; Hot N Juicy!",2.0

LlHigFXOHOWOO0-ZnUjGtw,"In general, one of my favorite breakfast places to go to in Pittsburgh. Setting of the restaurant is more like a diner than it is a restaurant, but that does nothing to detract from what it's best at serving: good old-fashioned breakfast food. The pancakes here are quite fantastic ... my favorite kind being the banana chocolate chip pancakes. Yeah, it's probably not light on calories, but to be honest, that's not really a thought if you opt to go for these. The chocolate chips are warm and well-melted into the actual pancake itself, making for one delicious yummy bite after the next. Their hot cakes are also a nice choice along with the stuffed raspberry French toast, which was oh so good. The raspberry sauce was actually not as tangy as I anticipated ... which is a good thing, considering that it would have been a sore spot (too sour) if it contrasted too much with the sweet consistency of the dish. In general this is a great breakfast spot to hit up ... oh and also a decent joint for sandwiches, my favorite being the Russian Reuben with the tender beef, great sauerkraut, along with the cheese & thousand island dressing combo that make for a delicious combination.",5.0

Since I didn't see anything else interesting, I went over and read all the info on the beers on tap.  Then I read them again.  Since the guy was sitting and laughing with a couple ten feet from me, I figured he'd ask if I wanted something.  Nope.

4oed1VdGhep5-l23SIBlJQ,"I'm not a sushi purist. While I'd love to eat nothing but delicate cuts of sashimi and simple, well-crafted nigiri, my wallet dictates that I feast on rolls if I want a satisfying meal without spending a fortune. And I have no problem eating crazy, sauce-covered rolls that would horrify most Japanese and drive them to seppuku. 

My tastes are Americanized, afterall, so rolls are cool with me. Their specialty rolls are half price all day, every day. But, if you use a restaurant.com gift card like I did on my first visit you have to pay full-price for the rolls.

The rolls we've tried have all tasted good -- the Bonzai, Red Dragon, Spicy tuna crunch, Hawaiian, and Yellowtail cover rolls. But, are sometimes sloppily assembled. Having ordered some of the rolls twice, we noticed that they don't always come out the same. QA issues aside, I can't really complain because the food is relatively inexpensive.

The yellowtail with jalapeño ($13) was also solid. We ordered tuna sashimi ($12) but what they brought out was seared tuna with a bunch of crispy stuff on top. We tried telling the waitress it was wrong but she insisted that that was how they do it there. Right... I guess that's what they tell all the non-Asian looking folk. 

That brings me to my biggest gripe about this place -- the service. They're friendly, but slow. If you want a quick meal this is the last place you should go. Expect a long wait to have your order taken and even more time to go by before you get your food. If you want refills, think again. Even if the place is empty, which it was on both of our visits, you'll spend a good hour and a half or more eating there.

At least the place is comfy. The interior is quite spacious and they have a few large TVs scattered around in addition to a projection screen and a stage where there is occasionally live music. Large booths are scattered around the room, making your wait time somewhat more enjoyable.

Despite its flaws, it's a good place to get some rolls at a decent price if you're not in a hurry.

JaCIWWIxp_SQoP2eHxR1sg,"Let me start by saying, I'mreally hoping that I visited on a bad day.  I LOVE Mexican and I wanted to like this restaurant so much because I thought I found a 'hidden jem' near our new house + all the reviews were so good, but...yikes.

Personally, I would think of this restaurant as more of a trendy take on Mexican.  Sort of Mad-Mexish maybe? But not exactly. I am normally not a person to salt my food, but I felt like just about EVERYTHING needed salt and/or was very bland.  It started with the salsa, then the guac, the pico then the rice and beans.  I mean TOTALLY BLAND.  I even got a pineapple margarita lacked flavor.  I thought there was something wrong with me but my friend I was eating with confirmed it. 

The salsa was brown and I'd guess was roasted tomato flavor?  I can appreciate a non-traditional salsa, but I dind't taste any seasonings and it didn't have a citric taste like any tomato salsa would normally have.  Next we ordered the tableside guacamole. We are guac finatics, but the pico they added had no citrus zing and it needed salt. They made it tableside, but it was already all in the bowl when she brought it and she just mashed it at the table.  

The pineapple margarita seemed to be made with fresh pineapple juice, which is awesome.  I ordered it blended and it was very watered down. but I dind't think $8 for an Avion margarita was that bad. 

I had the surf n turf burrito which was loaded with delicious tender steak and big shrimp, both cooked very well.  It was topped with a creamy orange colored sauce that was very tasty...but then they stuffed it with rice that had NO flavor. It looked redish orange, but had literally ZERO flavor. I had to ask the waitress for a salt shaker to even be able to eat it, but it barley helped. 

My friend had the grilled mahi mahi tacos which she said were really good.  But she had the same opinion on the rice. It also came with black beans that tasted like boiled, rinsed, dry black beans. No seasonings that we could detect. 

In fairness to the restaurant, I did not complain.  When this many things are wrong, you just kind of assume that this is how they make their food and that we just wont go back.

The CPO is truly one of the top orchestras in the country. The group has come a long way since its inception in 1955. Like all world-class orchestras, they offer the staples of concert series: Baroque (the Serenade Series), Classical and Pops. In more recent history, they have added a new music festival, a Tchaikovsky Festival and crowd-pleasing specials like Jeans &  Classics, Video Games Live, Bugs Bunny on Broadway and Star Trek. Their Saturday Morning at the Symphony Series is also quite popular.

I attended the Video Games Live 2.0 concert and one of the New Works performances in May. Their website provides a lot of information to help you make your purchase. The Box Office is extremely friendly, efficient and helpful when you need to contact them with a question or group ticket purchase.

The VGL 2.0 concert experience was a blast! They had gaming stations in the lobby, a costume contest, CD's, t-shirts, giveaways, and the Nintendo people were there. Even the Blindfolded Pianist of Youtube fame made an appearance. It was a huge celebration of gaming. Members of the audience came up to play Space Invaders and Guitar Hero. The orchestra played the music to match the players' progress (or lack thereof). 

In contrast, the New Works concert was a celebration of our Canadian composers. This was held at the Rozsa Centre. The group looked crowded on stage, but it somehow worked. I loved how the newest cellist waded his way to the front of the stage to make some opening remarks. There are a lot of new, fresh faces in the orchestra and they are giving the CPO a cool, hip vibe. 

That's a good thing. Yes, the orchestra needs to sound good, but to attract younger audiences, they also need to exude a bit of that ""coolness factor"", whether they're playing Bach, Brahms, Alan Gordon Bell or Bugs Bunny.

The artists came out to talk after each performance as well.

Those Hagen-Daaz bars are a great treat too.

Venues are top notch. The Jack Singer Concert Hall has wonderful acoustics. If you're going for sound, there isn't a bad seat in the house. If you want a good view, some seats are better than others. There is a good range of tickets, from dirt cheap to top of the line to meet any budget.

Seating is really good at the Rozsa Centre. It's a smaller facility but everything sounds and looks good in there. It's got a more intimate feel to it as well.

As for the ""front of house"" environment, they've recently made some updates in the lobby that make traffic flow smoother, but that's the EPCOR Centre's domain so I won't go more into that.

It's really cool that they have orchestra members interacting more with the public with things like SMATS, opening addresses and the Ask a Musician section on their website.

Berthold Auerbach once said that ""Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life."" Does the CPO deliver on this? Yes they do. They are a dedicated bunch and they play ""con molto espressione"".

[EDIT: To be absolutely honest, I worked @ CPO a very long time ago. It's been over 12 years ago and I don't know anyone there anymore so I trust that it's safe to review without any conflicts.]",5.0
mkPvnPXW70fZXDE8cwP72A,"I came here during my Vegas trip and thoroughly enjoyed myself. We went a bit after lunch so there was no line-up. There was a huge selection of food and everything I tried (mostly pasta and desserts) was delish!

The only thing was that the drinks were RIDICULOUSLY expensive! My friend paid ~$88 for about 3 people, which was already expensive, and a basic alcoholic drink was $16 on its own.

Last Saturday went to Chilly's for Breakfast, had the Cornbeef Hash and eggs and a short stack and was good.

The Bartender was really good he kept our beers field and cold and he took with the dirty dishes from the nachos he was good. The food servers were nice and very easy to approach and all four occasions, we've been lucky and have really good service.

t0c_HRvrQNS6cjoWwunCxA,"This bar is the manifestation of bigotry and homophobism. There is currently (1/17/16 2:30 AM) a bouncer working at Bar Madame Lee who was so disgusted by my appearance with my partner that he came up to us, asked me if I was bothering anyone (which I was not), which obviously made my drunk self angry. You may argue that I was drunk that's why this event occurred, but this bouncer hired to be ready for this type of behavior. I proceeded to tell him to mind his own business. After this, he took offense from my ridiculously ""gay"" behavior and put me in a headlock, dragged me out the door, and threw me into the middle of the street. I did not fight back. After I began to get up, this homophobic bouncer took me by the head, and threw me back onto the ground. He left me alone after this. Madame Lee, if you keep this bouncer hired after this repulsive night, I will make sure that not only does your club suffer legal action, but furthermore it will enjoy no more visitors.

3EtyjR3CMAXf0XgMBRuEFQ,Si Senor is not my favorite taco option. I got a steak taco and the bit of steak was so little my meat was about the size of a quarter. I could hardly believe how little meat I had.   I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place.,2.0
-ByFBq0V5vKvKpSZ-Bv5Eg,"Ok, so how do I start. Well, we walked in and were greeted enthusiastically. It was a really warm welcome, and we were happy to be there. 

I'm not sure what happened, but we did not get what we ordered. Yes, we should have verified our order with our receipt, but we have ordered the same thing many times. We wanted the battered fish tacos, but got the grilled instead. They were good, but not what we were looking forward to today. 

I love their salsa bar with the variety of salsas, Pico and limes. We got a healthy serving of tortilla chips. Unfortunately, I think that we got the leftovers from the previous day since we arrived shortly after they opened. They were stale. Blah. 

The set up here was odd. There was the main dining area, and then a whole other side with a soda machine and condiment area. Except, there were no condiments, and I'm not sure the soda machine worked over there. The ceiling fans were on high, and were blowing our napkins around. The music came on a few minutes after we arrived, and was way too loud. 

I believe our cashier was named Gregorio, and he was the highlight of our experience. Extremely nice and enthusiastic. Other than that, this is my least favorite Baja Fresh to date.",3.0

The restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating for being express. It's clean and tables are always cleared for the next customer. 

The food is your average Greek food at less than average dine-in restaurants but more than mall prices. Also, the portion sizes for the price paid is great (the portions are huge). 

I like the veggie souvlaki dinner which comes with rice, a whole tomato slices in half and grilled with feta on top, and a sliced pita -- I really enjoyed this! My boyfriend always gets the chicken souvlaki dinner with rice and salad as sides (two souvlaki sticks of chicken are included). Overall, however, I'd say the prices are more on the higher end.

Of course, pets are welcome and there are clean up stations if your pet has an accident in the store.  The employees are friendly and take the time to get to know your dog if you go there regularly.  The merchandise can be a little pricey, depending on what you're purchasing.  Natalie, the Dog Trainer, is outstanding.  She clearly loves dogs and has the expertise and experience to help you train your dog.  I highly recommend her classes.  They were positive and fun.  Janine is a fantastic groomer.  The first time I took my dog there, she brought out the clipper to show me exactly how long my dogs hair would be after grooming.  She did a beautiful job, which I realized when I went to someone else at another place that had been recommended and where I was able to get in sooner.

Easy to set up an appointment. Note, like a lot of plumbers, there is a service fee to show up and analyze the problem. Their fee is waived if the work is allowed to be done. Plumber called before arriving during the time window. Checked it out and said that yes, it did need to be replaced. Sorry, can't recall his name now, but his English was not the greatest. I did up end speaking to Alex on the phone to make sure there was no misunderstandings.
On his way out, I did finally remember that my pressure regulator had been leaking for awhile and asked him to look at that too. I kept forgetting to have someone look at that, which is my fault. Had that replaced the next morning when he could go out and buy a new one.

Prices are decent especially for Vegas and the food is delicious.  I have never had something I didn't like.  My favorite was the brunch tapas menu.  For a set price (I think it was $20 for brunch plus $5 for mimosas) you get unlimited tapas and mimosas.  The tapas menu had about 20 items on it and everyone I had was amazing.  I was so full I had to stop.  The plantain empanada, mini burito, and Machaca Chilaquiles were particularly amazing.  My mouth is watering thinking about them.

As for the food, I thought it was good for the price. I had the double Charburger with cheese, which wasn't anything special but that isn't a bad thing. I thought the portion size (burger at least) was good, and everything tasted fresh which is a plus. 

For what it market seems to be, I think it is 4 star quality. It isn't anything that blows me away, but if I find a joint in this type of market that did I would be amazed. I'd say it is about on par with In N Out for me, just different finishing (In N Out has their sauce compared to just the mayo that was on my Double Charburger). 

If you like In N Out, I'd suggest giving Habit a try, I don't think you'll be too disappointed. If you tend to go mostly to BK/McD then you need to go to Habit right away, it will blow those two out of the water (and I love BK now and then).",4.0

In all fairness though, I've only been to Wildflower 2-3 times, but I've been to Paradise more times than I care to count.

Wildflower has a much bigger selection of salads and sandwiches than Paradise with is nice because Paradise always has the same stuff and it really never ever changes.  Wildflower's menu seems to be very fresh.

Wildflower has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and cookies along with a friendly and clean atmosphere.  The other day I had one of their 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad specials.  I got the roast beef and Gorgonzola with a side Ceasar.  The sandwich was ok but pretty impossible to eat without making a complete mess.  The salad was also very good but had too much dressing on it.

After wanting to try River Cafe for ages, I finally had the opportunity last weekend to celebrate my sister in law's birthday. Little did I know, it was actually a food & wine pairing, which I had never done before. Needless to say I was excited, considering how much I love both of those things!

The restaurant itself is gorgeous, but that goes without saying. Situated in the middle of Prince's Island Park, you can either park near the Eau Claire shopping centre, or across Memorial in the lot. Our reservation was for 5pm, so the sun was still shining through the big, open windows and the breeze flowed through beautifully. The decor is simple, yet classy and feels upscale but not pretentious. The overall feeling is warm & cozy, as evidenced by the beautiful throw blankets set aside for guests who get chilly. Love it already!

Once we arrived we were tended to by a wonderful server. I missed his name but he was fabulous - and 10 steps ahead of all of us. When someone dropped a napkin, he was there to pick it up before you even realized it fell. When you ran out of water, he was topping it up before you had the chance to ask. He was extremely polite, friendly, and knowledgeable about everything we were being served. He informed us that we would be going through 9 courses, so thank goodness I was starving! We ordered cocktails to start, I had the River Ice and it was fabulous! Light & refreshing and exactly what I was looking for.

I know I won't remember any of the wines we were paired, all I know is that I had never given it much thought until this meal. The way the wine complimented every flavor in each dish was exquisite! We started with a soup - pureed vegetables with fresh cream and a piece of prosciutto on top. It was very tasty, albeit not as hot as I would prefer. Our next course was a lovely crab salad with asparagus & yellow and red tomatoes.  Ahhh perfection. Next we had eggplant with vine ripened tomatoes and cheese (the kind escapes me, it WAS a wine pairing after all). Once that was finished we had squid with a side of greens & toasted chickpeas. It was so delicious! When the lamb came out I was thrilled (ohgodsodamngood) it was paired with a small onion, asparagus, and crusted pork belly - mmmmm. Next was a bison tenderloin which was easily my favourite. At this point I was getting full and drunk! The desserts started coming, the first of which was a delicious ice cream sandwich with cookies, vanilla ice cream, and a delicious raspberry jam/drizzle! We finished that off with a small cheese board and finally, chocolate truffles. The presentation of each dish was well thought out and beautiful, and the wine pairings were truly beautiful and complimentary.

I won't lie I loved every single thing we had and I ate everything off each plate. It was decadent and everyone in the group really loved it - not just the food, but the entire experience. It was such a special evening and one I wont soon forget. The food along with the amazing service ensured I will DEFINITELY be back, and I can't wait - that beautiful patio is a must!",5.0

pwjU_wUscI1A41oA9Y9Now,"Just had such a ridiculously terrible experience here. Our waitress, Penny, extremely neglectful until the end of the meal when she paced back and forth in front of our table a record number of times compared to how scarcely we saw her while eating. 

First off, she took 2 other orders before ours even though we were sat before both those tables and were ready to order. Menus closed and everything. Next while taking our order she didn't write it down (which isn't a smart move in a restaurant with such a large menu) and got BOTH of our orders wrong. My friend asked for fruit, and was given hash browns. And I was not only missing avocado, but even though I emphasized to have my caramelized onions well down they came out almost raw.

She kept doing this extremely irritating thing where she would drop items and run away and not even give her paying customers an extra .3 seconds to ask her for something. When our wrong food arrived, once again, dropped and ran away. Waited almost 5 min for her to come back. She told my friend to just keep the hash browns while she just grabbed her fruit, and went to go have my omelet remade. I left my barely touched, incorrect omelet on the table edge with untouched potatoes (theres a difference between potatoes and hash browns here. They're two different sides) so finally my new omelet arrives, with no potatoes on the plate, yet she takes my incorrect plate, which had my potatoes, and doesn't come back with another side of potatoes for me.... potatoes that I paid for. So basically, I was served an omelet with no side and was forced to eat the cold, soggy hash browns that she didn't bother removing from the table when they came incorrectly with my friends meal. Nice.

Don't see her, doesn't check in till almost another 10 minutes even though I see her wandering around the restaurant. 
Which was crappy because my second omelet was gross. Yes, the onions were finally cooked, but the whole omelet was burnt and dark brown, plus THE ENTIRE THING WAS CHEESE AND TOPPINGS. I picked around it and basically left an uneaten, picked at scramble mess on my plate in front of me, obviously it was clear I didn't like it, and not a single inquiry from her as to why I barely touched my food. Every single thing about my friend and I was screaming that we were dissatisfied. From body language, to how our interactions with her changed throughout the meal, to the most obvious red flag which was that I barely ate anything. Then she leaves that mess in front of me till after she drops the check which took her 15 more minutes  (she did the classic run and drop without a word so we didn't even have the chance to complain). Aka I had these dirty plates in front of me till after we even payed. Which was when she was pacing back and forth in front of us straight up staring at us as we placed our money down. When she finally collected the plates she goes ""you done?"" Then grabs the dirty plates AND my drink that I payed $6 for that had almost half left in it, and runs away. Yes penny, I've been done with this terrible omelet for almost a half an hour, but no, I was NOT done with my barista beverage. At the end of the meal we purposefully sat, and I counted 7 times that she paced back and forth in front of our table staring at the checkbook which was in a place where she couldn't grab it. It's crazy how her presence improved once the money was involved. 

To top it off, there was a man sitting at the high top on a laptop, who I assume to be a manager or someone of authority because employees were discussing business with him. He was faced directly at our table, less than 10 feet away, and didn't once notice our dissatisfaction. Terrible. 

I paid $30 to sip half of a drink, eat 3 bites of cold, soggy hashbrowns, and to pick through a mountain of swish cheese and burnt, scarce egg.

My friend and I have both been in the restaurant industry for almost 7 years. This was by far the most expensive and dissatisfactory meal we've ever had the burden of paying for. Penny had so many opportunities too, that is the worst part of this situation. She could have taken it upon herself to read our body language, acknowledge that fact that I didn't touch my food, taken 2 extra seconds to actually SPEAK to her guests and we would have been back and tipped her well for her efforts.

Another ironic part of the situation is that this was my friends first time here, and we were scouting for a nice, slightly upscale restaurant to host/cater a baby shower brunch for about 30 people.
For 2 of us our bill was $50, imagine having a party of 30. You do the math. That's a lot of business you just lost.

I could do without them in general. They remind me of fish food. My wife got the house ramen and  really liked it. The noodles were tender and the broth was hearty, and right amount of salt.

Also, no appointments. There's a clipboard you sign in on, and he does them in order (although he will call when done if you drop off).
Have to say that Gary is very thorough. He drives it, works on it, drives it again to double-check, and tweaks it if it isn't just perfect. The Taco definitely seems to be aligned correctly, and drives good.  
Read other reviews that say he seems like he ignores you.  True, he stays focused on his work and isn't much of a talker, but I think the clipboard is his version of automated check-in.  He's not real pricey either.- which is getting rare nowadays.

EpKer-POMmbUOZs1N9pS8Q,"I used one star because thats the lowest I could pick. This place is an absolute hell hole. Every time I have gone in the store I become more and more amazed what a mess the place is. Walmart could improve their corporate image immensely if they just tore the place down and started over again. If you look up the word disaster in the dictionary, I swear they should have a picture of this store next to the meaning.
The merchandise on the shelves is frequently not priced. Don't expect to get help from an employee because I don't think there are any and at the very least, you'll probably stand a better chance getting run over by a heard of buffalo while in the store. Very often, when the merchandise is placed on the shelves there is absolutely no method as to how it's arranged. Things are mixed up beyond belief. For a current example, I recently I went there to buy an oil filter. I should have known better but I was in a hurry. When I got to the isle with the filters I found them all completely mixed up. They were placed on the shelves in no particular order with all the different sizes, and there are literally scores of different sizes, totally un-arranged and mixed up. It looked like someone just literally dropped the filters out of an airplane and wherever they landed that's where the employees put them. There was no reference book to find the filter number I needed. They had an electronic engine filter finder but it didn't work. Needless to say, I gave up.
Unfortunately it's not just the auto department either. Same thing in lawn and garden. Same thing in housewares. etc., etc.
If you need to go to Walmert do yourself a favor and go to the one in Chardon. You'll be shocked by the difference.
As I think about it, you probably should go in the store at least once. It's an experience you will never forget!",1.0

f9Sk9-mMD5JkECDjhXWqvw,"Came here for a brunch/lunch on our last day in Vegas. With six girls and all varying tastes and preferences, this was a great choice! Mexican food is always a hit, and I particularly enjoy it, so I was really pleased when the birthday girl suggested it! She'd been here on a previous trip to Vegas and recommended it.

We came here at 11:00 because that was when they started serving lunch. They also offer an all-inclusive brunch of small plates, but we were not up for another buffet before the long flight home. We did order a couple of appetizers (guacamole and queso). The guac was really good, and the chips were a huge standout. Freshly fried, they were super fresh and difficult to stop eating. They came with three types of salsa, all of which were good. (None were particularly spicy, but they were all flavorful). The queso was a bit on the runny side for my taste, which also made it difficult to share.

I ordered nachos for my lunch- if you know me, you'd expect this. The nachos suffered from structural issues in their construction. The beans were spread all over the bottom of the plate, with chips on top of them. Toppings were layered on top and baked, so the chips never stood a chance. They were super soggy by the time they made it to the table. The flavor was good, but I mostly picked the chips from the top and left the sodden bottom layer. I added steak to the nachos, and this was a very good choice- the meat was hot, cooked medium, and made a great addition to the dish.

Other girls got tacos, and that's definitely what I would order the next time. Enjoy the crispy chips as an appetizer, but I don't recommend the nachos unless you make a special request to re-structure. Our waitress was nice but pretty absent, and I don't think that type of special request would have been well-received, although I think they would have done it.

WewOJjLmKiCqrp6fNvUjPQ,"Over a year ago, the company that employs me changed office locations. My colleagues and I decided to check out restaurants around the area. We found this gem less than a huge Mississauga block away from our office building.

The food never fails me. I love the sandwiches there (the roast beef and chicken are my favourites). I have a weakness for quiche, with the broccoli and ham varieties to be my go-to choices. I also love soup that you can get as a side with your meal. I love the beef and barley vegetable, and the minestrone soups.

The interior is cozy. There is a fireplace (think it's fake, but I could be wrong), a large marble table, a huge London-inspired round clock on the wall, and many tables and seats at the back of the restaurant.

Long story short, the screen was fixed and I paid $140 for that (plus an extra $70 for a new case and screen protector) but the tech said my battery was working fine, so it wasn't replaced.  

About two weeks later, it was clear that there was still a problem with my battery. I took my phone back and explained that I was frustrated that it wasn't correctly fixed the first time. The man working at the front desk did not ask me any questions or second guess me at all; he simply apologized, replaced my battery at no cost, explained what I can do to preserve my battery going forward, and thanked me for my business. 

(It should also be noted that, on another occasion, they also did a super quick and simple fix on my husband's phone and did not charge him for that either.)

It seemed to be a quick serve, but the order took anything but quick which was a big disappointment. Second there is another mandir ( a Hindu temple) next door which complicated the parking situation quite a lot. 

First the Cookies and Cream Milkshake was close to the real one, but could still taste the coconut milk aftertaste. A tad too sweet for us. Nevertheless 3.5/5. 

The Wrap made vegan, was a a complete disaster. We have faux meat (chicken, beef, fish) however the Kalga warp is nowhere close to the real thing. Not even close to faux chicken we have had. The texture and taste was completely different and tasteless. Not chewy, not seasoned and had a red outer lining that tasted and seemed weird. The pieces were tiny squares. The Wrap was a complete turnoff. (1/5)

The spiced Wedges again was disappointing. The sauce was tangy perhaps the same they use for chaat (the tamrind chutney/sauce). The spices were non present and the Wedges would have tasted better plain!  (2/5)

K27uiM_518Hh0oB-UG0BVg,"I am now what I would consider a expert Timeshare traveler.  I purchased my timeshare in 2005 in Sedona and have stayed in about seven of them since then. Funny thing is that we have never stayed in our own, we don't usually visit he same place twice.  From Montana to South Florida, we have certainly have gotten great use out of our timeshare purchase.  

With that being said, I found this resort to be one of the best we have ever stayed at.  We reserved a two bedroom for 5 of us, two couples and a young adult child.  We were assigned to the Rosemary tower which was one of the newly renovated towers.  We had both rooms for the lockout suite, which included two full 1 bedrooms to give a total of two King bedrooms, 2 kitchens and 2 living rooms.  The rooms are connected by an outer area, and we were able to keep the doors open to feel like we have a huge open apartment.  The space we had was incredible.

The resort is situated right next door to the Southpoint casino.  When you check in at the resort they give you coupon books for the casino.  When you go to the resort, go sign up for the rewards program before you purchase or do anything.  It only takes 5 minutes and with the 1st coupon in the book, you get $20 free slot play.  We had fun with the 4 of us playing our $20 each.  No one won but we had fun.  The rewards card gets you money off the buffets and the coupons give free bottles of wine you can take back to your room. 

I was quite surprised at how the good the food was at the buffets.  The prime rib was really good.  We went on Surf Turf and grapes night.  Each adult buffet came with 2 free glasses of wine and then we took a bottle back to our room with the coupon.  

The next morning we went back for the buffet $6.95 a person with your rewards card.  This included your coffee and juices.  Although not generally a fan of breakfast buffets, this one was decent.  The negative, this one is packed.  It ""closes"" at 10 am and you must clear out by 10:30.  We got there about 9;45 and it was a madhouse.  Get there early!  And opt for the fresh omelet station, well worth the wait then the buffet scrambled eggs.

One of the best things about the resorts was the pool.  It was the last week of July for our stay and it was hot.  Somehow, they were able to keep the pools cool and refreshing.  They felt amazing.

I can't say enough about this resort, friendly, spacious and very well maintained.

Been there done that, just don't go, you don't have to do it.",5.0

IszVzf6mXGO7EJkz1CA92A,"Whenever I'm too lazy to cook, and am in the mood for a large, comforting meal, I get the veggie Spicy Burger at Big Smoke (once also shamefully followed by a poutine at Poutini's...). Can't go wrong with the combination of chipotle mayo and caramelized onions...ever. The veggie patty itself is a ""meat imitation"", and isn't the moistest or tastiest faux burger patty I've ever had, but it fits the bill. Personally, I don't really care if my veggie burger tastes like real meat or not (as long as it doesn't taste like cardboard), but veggies who are looking for a true meat imitation may be disappointed. 

There are about 8 different ""signature"" burgers on the menu, with most ranging between $7 - $8. You can also create your own burger with toppings like roasted red peppers, avocado, and sauteed mushrooms. 

As others have mentioned, space is tiiggghhhtttt and seating is limited. Take-out seems to be a popular option here.

My friends had a mango mohito, and said that they were awesome. The service was good. The atmosphere is great.

But considering it was in walking distance and I was in Vegas this is the place to try new places. Me and my friend walked to here and from the get go it's a nice little cafe. Plenty of seating, and everyone is pretty friendly. There menu is nice, I mean I wish they were in Cali where the beaches are. It makes me kind of sad cause honestly it beats out the one breakfast/lunch place we have here. But at least it gives me somewhere to look forward too when I come back. Me and my friend ended up coming six days out of the seven days we were here. I ended up mainly getting the cafe breakfast with a bagel and bacon. And their iced coffee. I'll admit the first few times it was kind of watered down, but it did its job and it's free refills. Their sun kissed iced tea is yummy and sweet too. I did have their bbq bacon cheeseburger and fries and they were good too. I mean I wish I had tried more variety but I'm kind of a plain jane kind of guy. The cafe breakfast ended up being my go to, and I'm not a huge breakfast person. They also have specials here and there. They had a captain crunch French toast that was to die for . The prices were fair, I usually ended up paying about 10 for my food and drink. On top of it if you're the type to frequent this place. Ask for a meal card you get a free meal after about I believe 10 or 12 meals. But hey, free food is always good.",5.0
19uYlLrWvvy8VTBbEkA9yw,"South Point is a great place to kill time - there's gambling, bingo, movies, bowling, and video games.  My husband and I had a really good time.  It's not a fancy casino by any means, but it's clean and not overly smoky.  The bowling alley is also very clean.  The shoe rentals are a little beat up, but this facility has kept up well.  There are numerous lanes and people seem to be pretty aware of bowling etiquette.  Depending on the time of day, games and shoes go for $3.50/ea.  The lanes are all automated (bumper capable) and there are televisions interspersed if you get bored staring at your own screen.  

The workers there aren't overly friendly nor happy to be working, but they are efficient and willing to answer questions.  We didn't play any bingo or watch a movie, but the slots were fun and not completely begrudging in letting the patron win.

I went here for lunch with a few friends today.  Another friend of mine was raving about the hummus there.  I went with a standard Gyros Sandwich + Side Salad + Drink for 6.95.  It was a great price.  The salad was large with olives, peppers, feta, and beets.  The dressing was a balsamic.  Out of all the greek restaurants I've been to in Chandler, I was shocked to find this place had such a good salad.  The beets were an unexpected surprise, and the dressing was tangy.  The gyros had salad and tomatoes topped with gyros meat and tzatziki sauce.  The pita bread was warm and there was a lot of meat.  I think a few more sliced onions could've made it spectacular, but it was better than a lot of sandwiches I've had elsewhere.

auIOH8v6Qj74AQ3eBTd77g,"I used to love this swim school, and both my kids attended for several years. The sad truth is that, over the past 6 months to a year, Water Wings has gone downhill dramatically and drastically. My kids no longer swim at Water Wings for several reasons, but my chief concern was many new and inexperienced swim teachers that simply put, do not know how to effectively teach children to swim. Unfortunately, most of the seasoned instructors from years past either no longer work with the company or have moved to California to work at the newest location. I paid for private lessons (not cheap) and in many classes the primary instructor was busy ""training"" a new instructor or chatting with a colleague. I understand training is necessary but it shouldn't take away or undermine the meat of the lesson, especially considering the cost and limited time allotment.

As a parent one of my main concerns - besides the instructors' inexperience - is the lack of accountability for children's safety. Employees are neither background checked nor drug tested, which in my opinion, is unacceptable when staff is in direct contact with children. (Not only, but you are quite literally putting your children's lives in their hands when you hand them over in a pool.) Additionally, the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary. This became more apparent to me after switching my kids to swim at another facility. There have been many incidents over the years (dirty play area, grimy shower area, floating grossness in the pool) but the one that stands out to me was when an individual had vomited in the locker room. I notified the staff and instead of properly cleaning it up, they had sprayed it repeatedly with a noxious cleaner (but did not wipe or clean the area). Eww. 

The front desk staff is hit or miss. Some of them are super sweet and accommodating and some are rude and standoffish. As though they are better than you. Interesting. I've overheard them gossiping about their colleagues and other friends and even clients! Talking sh*t about your clients - and their kids - is not the best idea and is certainly unprofessional. I could go into more details but I think you get the point. 

Moral of the story is - I would have recommended years ago hands down. Today I would caution to stay away.",1.0

I will say they stayed in character regardless of the situation.  

You have to read a lot, which is not good for kids under 13.  They start the videos before you get done reading.  It isn't well timed.  People were right on our heels.  

There's not a lot for kids to do once you get past the initial 5 minutes of the skit.  It's a bit of looking at artifacts, which is boring.  My husband and I would have read the displays more thoroughly if they had something for the kids to do.

First of all, the rooms are not even comparable to other rooms on the strip. Every room at the Venetian is a huge suite with either a double queen or king size bed. What makes them stand out is that I love the layout of their suites. It has a living room area separated from the bed area, with a small set of stairs adjoining together. Simply brilliant & Simply gorgeous!! It always makes me feel so comfortable the moment I enter my room. And the marbled floor bathroom that looks like a mini palace!  Need I say more?

It was closed. To our unpleasant surprise, on weekdays they open at half past eleven. He recommended Tim Hortons but I distracted him at Chapters until the clock struck 11:30. Best decision of my life.

The server was friendly and took our order right away. While we waited for our food we drew each other with crayons on the paper table cloth. Some of my finest artistic work has been executed on restaurant napkins and pub coasters. Dr. G's tablecloths provide space for extra large portraits. Mine resembled a cross between a fat blob and a furry yellow animal with blue saucers for eyes. 

When the food came, I forgot about my masterpiece. I ordered the Egg Dostoyevsky with mushroom cheddar chowder. It was perfect -- the egg was perfect, the sauce, the toasted bagel.

My boyfriend ordered the tuna melt. He evidently loved it because it was devoured within seconds. It came with the soup of the day, which he also liked. I also recommend ordering the fresh and pulpy orange juice, especially when attempting to cure a hangover.

I have also had them inspect 2 used vehicles that I was purchasing and saved hundreds of dollars with the information they provided. This past summer they saved our family vacation by squeezing us in the day before we were supposed to leave to fix a repair done by another shop 2 years earlier when the parts failed and the other shop didn't have time to do it right. They even worked with the parts supplier to apply the warranty. I recommend them.,5.0

The current effort seems to be to transform Applebee's into a steak house along the lines of Outback Steakhouse. They have a rack with hunks of wood and a sign touting the Wood Fired Grill items in the entry and steak knives that look identical to the Outback Steakhouse. 
I had seen an ad on TV for their wood grilled sirloin steak plus two sides for just $9.99 for a limited time (it will be $12.99 after the initial promo). I had a tasty 6 ounce sirloin steak grilled just the way I like it and garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. All the food was very good and the steak was even tender.

Details:

Visit #1: We arrived as walk-ins. We were asked to come back in 3 hours. Then they called us and asked us to come back an extra 30 mins later. We were ok with that and obliged. However, even after 3 1/2 hours of delay, we still ended up waiting for an additional 20 mins before we had to leave and walked out. 

Visit #2: We made an appointment this time. We arrived on time and we STILL ended up waiting for 35 mins. 

I have been to many nail studios over the years and would not be surprised in the least if the nail techs aren't certified. 

The manicure was inefficient with many snags and hangnails left over, polish left on the cuticle and skin or not covering the nail completely. My nail tech was attempting to polish on the very the last molecules of nail polish out of the empty container and I had to shape my own nail because she did them all crooked.

OAbtxQftd0lTeoUY8bcmag,"Some buffets you can go wrong with and some are great. This one was towards the great side with an average of 85% which is extremely high for a buffet. 
You never know what you are getting with a buffet such as how long the good has been out for or who has sneezed on what or who has touched what and put it back, etc. 
I love how they have divided up the sections into different cultures of food such as seafood, Mexican and Japanese. I stayed away from the Japanese section with the sushi because you never know with the raw fish how long it has been out there and if it has been stored properly. I was also disappointed with the Chinese food section. All they really had was dim-sum, dumplings and fried rice. Where was the sweet and sour pork or the ginger beef especially? 
The dessert section was definitely the best with all the ice cream you could imagine. However I was surprised that the salad bar was hidden and that the dessert section was at the front rather than at the end as dessert usually happens at the end of the meal but they had the dessert section first.",4.0

vgl9cYrqnYZT0lmvbiVT6w,"Fun place with three floors and three distict themes.  I visited the ""Meatball"" restaurant called Emporia on the first floor and the rooftop bar with a retractable roof on floor three, Il Trello.  Crowded but fun crowd.  Great service.  Third floor menu is really small and appetizers only.  It advertises bar food but you won't find a meal here.  Make sure you get your name on the list for Emporia or have reservations for Italian on the second floor if you are there for more than a few drinks and some buffalo dip and chips.  I was expecting wings or a burger in Il Trello.  Nope.  That said, the buffalo chicken dip was awesome.  Emporio was a surprise.  A meatball restaurant?  Absolute genius.  Meatballs included pork, beef, chicken, vegie and weekly special options.  Lots's of coices from pastas to paninis to bowls and large sauce and extras options.  The combinations are endless.  I had a spicy pork meatball grinder with alfredo sauce, parmesan and bacon bits at the waiter's recommendation.  Not the healthiest choice but darn good.  Half a sandwhich and I was full.  Fries are huge portions and should be shared.  I should have bought a t-shirt as they are quite amusing.  I highly recommend.",5.0

First of all, surrounding area is okay. Although, not something I was expecting in Gilbert. The interior is clean and spacious - nicely done.

The food portions were certainly generous enough.

That is the extent of positives that I have to say about this place. 

I ordered the #6 Combo Red Burro, enchilada style with Rice only, and I added a taco for good measure and comparison.

My summation: the Spanish rice needed more flavor, the meat in the taco was undercooked, and the cheese and vegetables didn't taste fresh at all. And the server seemed like she was very put out to take my order, and was very slow to refill my drink.

The first thing I noticed was how clean and sunny the restaurant is, which makes for a pleasant atmosphere.  They had some music playing, but not too loudly and there were some fantastic aromas coming out of the kitchen.

We didn't want to get too crazy because we had to run some errands afterwards, so just stuck with the oxtail lunch ($10.99) and the stewed chicken ($8.99).  I opted for the coconut rice & beans, and my husband got the white rice and stewed beans with his.  First thing, the meats are so tender and flavorful, I can't even begin to describe them.  I don't know anything about the seasonings they use, but together they provide very warm flavors that create perfect comfort food.  

Then the next thing, you have to take some of your rice and put it in the broth that comes with the meats so it can soak up those wonderful flavors too.  Oh my God, but that was good.  A couple of maduros and a cup of potato salad come with the meals as well.  I love maduros and don't get to eat them very often, so they are always a treat.  The potato salad was nice and creamy and eggy, just like grandma used to make.  

They also had conch soup on the daily specials board, and when Elvira overheard me say I forgot to order some, she brought us a little sample with rice to try.  That was delicious as well.  Dining here makes me want to learn more about the seasonings they use.  That was our first time here, but it definitely won't be the last.

And then, on top of all of this, I got hit with tax and a county surcharge.  I paid $87 more (total) on top of my basic rate of $62/day (3 days), which brings my total bill to $91/day.

I ordered a Kiss my cucumber that, as advertised, was a bit short of a mojito. Yes please! When it arrived it was actually really gross. Gin, water, and cucumber doesn't sound like anyone's choice. Not wanting to dampen our night out I thought maybe if I add some sugar and lemon it would help but no. Brought it up and the Manager was so snotty. Read your menu, know your product before you argue with a customer. At least offer to take it off the bill.
Accepting that it's just a drink and moving on I ask for a box to take my food, which was pretty decent, the server gave me a warped to go box.

There was no cover that night and we end up posted at the bar, since there weren't any tables left, while the jazz band was still playing.  The bartenders definitely took care of us that night and we made sure to tip well.  The music was good and we were all enjoying the vibe and the opportunity to celebrate the wknd!

I ordered shredded pork, potato salad, and baked beans. There is plenty of food so we decided to take home  a peach cobbler. We were very impressed and have now been there another 3-4 times. I personally like a variety of flavors in my meals so this place is excellent. You get a variety of BBQ sauces from which to choose for your meat. The potato salad is creamy and not mustardy but if you want some, you can get a packet at the condiments corner.  The baked beans are sweet and just perfect in my opinion. We took home the peach cobbler and it was absolutely delicious right out of the fridge. I actually prefer it cold better than warm.  The corn pudding is fine but lacked flavor in my opinion. There is a small loaf of cornbread that is good and honey is found in packets at their condiments corner. Every time we go there, nice young men circulate the room to be sure your food satisfies you. My hubby and I have settled on this as our favorite place to eat BBQ. They cater and we will surely be using them for that. The prices seem very reasonable for catering. You can leave your dirty dishes on the table to be bussed but I usually bus my own to leave more room for the next customers.

vqkcHWBkmEMC6xd1C4Xslg,"I should have kept my reservation at the other hotel, but my friends event coordinator told me they had rooms blocked here, so I booked. 
It is a fine place to stay, but definitely needs improvements. 
Pros:
-Nicely done property, well kept gardens and grounds
-Nice staff, pleasant
-Kind of funny decor, like a wacky haunted house. Nothing wrong with it, it is pleasant enough
-Plenty of parking
-Spacious gym with lots of options
-7 minute drive to town



Cons: 
-The guy with the leafblower comes blasting by at 9am. I'm from CA so it was 6am for me and it's a terrible sound to wake up to. They should do this kind of loud stuff in the afternoon
-No bellboy to help with bags
-Continental bkfst, but with mediocre items and highly processed foods: yogurt full of sugar, Kroger-type croissants (you can smell the chemicals in them), half and half in the plastic cups, cereals full of sugar. I had some ""homemade granola"", but I question if it were really homemade b/c it too, tasted like chemicals. I'd expect something a bit more classy and better quality for 180/night. I just ate the fruit & went to town to find bkfst. 
- The toiletries smell like Pine Sol
-No bathtub in our room
-The TV reception is very poor. Kept going out and static - We really coudln't watch a channel for more than 10 mins without it going on the fritz
- They want you to pay for the gym per day. I find this insulting and tacky. I think it's 7 or 8 bucks a day. 

Overall, it is fine if you're in a pinch. Not that I go to Cleveland very often ever, but I would choose not to stay here again, only because it really needs some updating and attention to details. If they improved just a few things, it woudl make all the difference. It is too expensive a price point for what you get.",2.0

ouehYUlrMzvA3aHclsi_zw,"I'm a GoodLife member, and have been for years and years.

Switching to another gym was pretty much out of the question, as I had a very regimented routine I pretty much 'enjoyed' at Goodlife, and I'm very independent, so the lack of experienced trainers, etc is something I cared less about.

Ya don't mess with a girls' schedule & routine!

But I was curious, and when I saw the 30 day pass pop up on GroupOn pop up, it was my opportunity to check this place out .... 
 
While the monthly membership is significantly more than what you'd pay at a chain-facility, you're getting completely different caliber of (clearly) highly educated staff, classes that you'll actually continue to attend week after week, just so you can see yourself improve. 
 
It's only a bonus the trainers actually work out themselves! (unlike the 'fluffy' looking staff at most GL's) 
 
I'm not exactly the typical gym-goer; I'm not there just to go through the motions. I'm not a cardio bunny.  I want a challenge, I want someone to show me something new.  In fact, I didn't realized how stagnant my own workouts had gotten -- I'd been doing my own training, or I'd hire an online coach that specializes in what I was doing at that point in time.  I'd always been providing for myself .. 

UNTIL i attended a 'group' class at Totum.
I usually don't even bother with classes, as I never found them challenging or enjoyed them  ....  
It was amazing. I had felt muscles I'd been working for years, but the variety kicked my ass. And I was hooked from week 1. 

I'm down 2.5"" on my waist, and it's been 3 weeks of steady Bells & Balls classes, and a crap load of other classes that are guaranteed to get you into the best shape of your life if you're willing to put your heart and soul into it. 

I also love that the other members of this facility really do love working out, and pushing themselves ... which is a drastic change from a mediocre facility with a million machines, and personal trainers who are barely 'certified' under CanFit Pro. 

The staff at Totum are a different caliber: They're Kinesoloigists', they're Physiotherapists ...They've completed Iron Mans', triathlon's, they can talk to you about Paleo and Ketogenic dieting ...  and they practice what they preach.. they're legit. They're the real deal.

I am in love with this place.
I have to admit.

UNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE AND HE TALKED DOWN TO ME AS IF I DID SOMETHING HORRIBLE. 

Dr. Hyson consulted with me all of 4 minutes and refused to let me explain what my issues are. He cut me off every time I spoke dismissing my concerns. He actually argued with me over the meaning of paralysis. He is very mean, rude and arrogant.

I am concerned if he is really an educated doctor, anyone can throw up some wall doctorate plaques and rent an office.

My visit was unproductive as my concerns and issues were not addressed and I was not given the opportunity to talk about my health or recent problems.

He walked off as I was ushered to the front to schedule another appointment. I said NO! I won't be scheduling another appointment because I won't be back and never want to see him again.

He walked by seeing me in tears, I told him I am disappointed and VERY unhappy with our 5 minute visit. I told him he was rude for cutting me off and not allowing me to address my concerns. I said why on earth would a real ""doctor"" sit there an argue with a patient? He replied,""I am busy and a lot of people like me"". ""He said we can go back in the room and he will listen now"" I replied NO, I want to get as far away from you as I can. I left in tears and crying uncontrollably. 

I was devastated when I sat and read his bad reviews in the waiting room after checking in. I did not choose this doctor it was a referral so I had no choice. 

He lives up to his bad reviews! His personality is as lively as a dead flower. I don't expect personality but don't abuse me by shushing me when I am trying to give you important details of my health problems.

The down side is the housekeeping staff is extremely loud, we were trying to relax in the morning before our flight home, they were talking and laughing so loud I got up and looked out the door to see who was making so much noise it was the housekeeping staff while cleaning the rooms down the hall ( not even next door, down the hall!) most businesses ask employees to be mindful of guests,  guess not here ,I'm glad we were not trying to sleep, I would have called the front desk. the other downside was the breakfast it was the worst out of all the trip, only protein was cold hard boiled eggs you had to peel, really poor breakfast I expected more from a Vegas property",3.0

Pros: good cappuccino, but found it pricey ($4.25), considering it is a hop, skip from Myriade where you can get better. Good amount of fruit used in the dishes that call for it. Dark chocolate sauce on our waffle was ok.
Cute interior and friendly staff.

Cons:
Waffle was really bad. Hard and crunchy throughout and very sweet, almost tasted old. Definitely a no.
The chocolate soufflé was more like chocolate syrup. Only the top was baked and the rest was completely liquid. Vanilla ice cream on the side was crazy sweet, very cloying taste, not rich but watery consistency.
The crepe part of the peanut butter crepe concoction was supposedly very thick and not good, although I didn't taste that one. Crepe was also supposedly very dry.
Three desserts, three cappuccinos and one small Pellegrino cost $56 +tip. I wouldn't mind, but when we decide to go out for a treat, we want to actually have it taste like a treat. This was incredibly ""meh"".

npL8Akh3-jSJlADxJycmfw,"The tea flavours did not disappoint! They were very strongly flavoured because they used real brewed tea. I got the Jasmine milk tea scoop, and my friend got the Hojicha. We also sampled the Thai iced tea soft serve.

Jasmine milk tea: the flavour was strong and milky, but the ice cream was a bit strange. It was harder on consistent, but had a semi-chewy/chunky texture that confused me. I looked into the issue and found these soft white blobs that looked like frozen lard. Wasn't sure if that's supposed to be normal, but I wasn't feeling social enough to inquire. 

Hojicha: tasted like strongly roasted milk tea from Chatime. 

Thai iced tea: I should've gotten this one. It was a soft serve so it takes less effort to scoop, and the flavour was strong. Thai iced tea is usually my go-to, but I decided to change it up today.

9fmkgipIf82gtiE2ZT33gw,"We had a birthday dinner last Friday night at Hush with about 15 people. Hush for me has the potential to be an amazing restaurant. The interior is beautiful, modern and cozy. It's located on King Street right in front of the Tiff Theatres and have wonderful staff who are attentive and friendly. 

The food however is another story.I ordered the lobster tacos and we found it unseasoned, had a lot of water and generally not very good. For our mains, I ordered the seafood pasta and I found that there were way to many ingredients in the sauce including brocolli and not enough fresh seafood. However, it tasted okay. My boyfriend ordered their steak and fries and found everything too salty. Their fries had kosher salt crystals on top. Our friend on the other side found the same experience with the fries but his burger was under seasoned. Overall, I think seasoning could be improved. 

However, the best part of our meal was the smores dessert where they allow you to toast your marshmellows and create smore sandwiches at the table. This experience brought back child hood joy to everyone! It was great :)",3.0
yo2mbVAAuYyWo6YI9Ut1uQ,"Great little place (way) off the strip, I love italian food, and this place wasn't too bad. I came here with my girlfriend and split a carpaccio dish, veal with shiitake mushrooms, and a gnocchi dish with her. I don't eat veal a lot, but I was a little surprised at how it came out; the sauce and mushrooms were great, along with the steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes it came with, but for some reason the veal just wasn't what I was picturing in my head. Don't let that deter you though, that might just be how veal is, and I didn't know it. 

The gnocchi was excellent, very flavorful with the gorgonzola sauce, and it was hard to stop eating even though I was already stuffed. 

The waitstaff were excellent as well! Our personal waiter wasn't that friendly and seemed a little scatterbrained, but all the other people on the floor more than made up for it. I'm pretty sure some of the people that stopped to talk to us were either the owner or the manager. and the hostess was most helpful in calling a cab for us and then letting us know when it arrived.",4.0

KgZgcHOWh10lNvSfrs8HXA,"From what I can tell this will be Joe's Audio's first review. I don't understand how that could be. His business seems like it's been in the same place for a few years now but I think after doing business with him he's just too nice of a guy and doesn't market himself aggressively.

I found him on Craigslist and to be honest I was apprehensive because the auto services part of CL can be a little shady. My primary motive for using him was he was fairly priced and he was close. I had many other quotes but he was the lowest. The others that were close to matching his price were located on the other side of the valley so the drive and gas kind of ate up what ever little profit margin there was gong to be.

I had just bought a new used Tundra. The stereo was stock but I was looking to upgrade to a touchscreen with a few extras. I wanted a rear view camera, my steering wheel controls and a Mira box installed that allowed me mirror my cell phone onto the touch screen. I don't know a lot about installing stereos but I thought it was going to take a lot of time to do everything I asked...and it did. It took Joe about 5 to 6 hours. 

Once the job was done, it exceeded my expectations. The stereo looked great, the rear camera worked well and the steering wheel controls responded like they should. We were kind of fumbling through the Mira box but it was more the fact we hadn't read the instructions and not because it was installed incorrectly. 

The best part of the experience was Joe. He responded quickly to my phone calls, emails and texts. He was even kind enough to provide a part I had forgotten at his cost. He showed me the receipt. I had a very positive experience with him and would recommend him to anyone that was looking for a stereo install. He's extremely reasonably priced and a nice guy to work with.",5.0

KMRGYcKegZp8q6NGhTyK-A,"If you've ever lived in another city with ancient and archaic arenas stepping foot into T-Mobile Arena will be an amazing experience. My first visit was for UFC 216 which happened less than 1 week after the 1 October incident. Even with enhanced security the lines to pass through the metal detectors were short and the list of prohibited items was clearly displayed. And security did their jobs thoroughly without any attitude which is appreciated. 

Once you step inside you'll find wide, uncluttered concourses and clear and concise signage to help you find your seat quickly. When I had a question I had no trouble finding a staff member and they were friendly and helpful. 

And once you have a seat you'll find that compared to some arenas T-Mobile has a slight bit more leg room...it may not seem like there's much but if someone has to pass by you to get to their seat and they have their hands full there's just enough space for them to pass and not trip on people's feet or the seats. And the steps are wide enough and spaced appropriately to help avoid a tipsy / vertigo effect that some arenas have. 

Sight lines to the arena floor are very good. I'm not exactly short and the seat banking was enough that for once the people behind me didn't complain about the tall guy in front of them blocking the view. And the audio quality is definitely a step up from many venues I've been in. It's loud but very clear regardless of if it was a fighter's entrance music being played or Bruce Buffer's voice announcing the winner of the match!

Concessions: Yeah, they are pricey. Ridiculously so. But from buying food to picking up a UFC T-Shirt the lines moved quickly, and I got ""Service with a smile"" and I always like that when it happens! 

Restrooms: Yeah there's always lines, but the lines were short. And I didn't have to wait 15 minutes for my wife as she was able to get in and out quickly, and she said the restrooms were actually clean. Compared to other venues this is definitely a much better experience. 

Parking: I know locals loved free parking but you can kiss that goodbye. MGM makes it easy to go online and pay for parking in advance and get a discount if you order at least 24 hours ahead of the event. Print out your receipt, come to the event, and the parking staff makes it easy to get into the parking garage. I'll go so far as to say this was the best parking experience I've had at any arena, stadium, or large event that I've ever been to! Once you're in the garage just look up as any open parking spaces are marked with a green light. It makes finding a space so easy! And exiting was just as easy as it took less than 10 minutes from when we left the parking space to being back out on the street and heading for I-15! 

In short, T-Mobile definitely reflects the latest and greatest in arena design, and you can tell a lot of thought was put into the overall visitor experience. 4 Stars. (IMHO T-Mobile blows Mandalay Bay's arena and the MGM Grand Garden out of the water...it's superior in every way to those venues).",4.0

They treat their tenants horribly, they literally watch you every second to the point where the doors to the elevators open as you walk up to them with your floor button already pressed. The fact that they literally watch you every second takes away from being able to truly relax in comfort. The HOA is THE WORST!! Walked our dogs out on a rainy day and was given a formal warning because we walked back in through the front door because we didn't want to walk around the building to go through the back door designated for pets in the pouring rain. However if your car is in the valet they don't mind if you walk your pets through the front, go figure. The pet area stinks so bad! You can smell it from the front walk way, and on really hot days it wreaks even worse. They also have a designated length of what your leash should be.. really who does that!? Spend your money some place else, this place is the worst. Also they say that you can only load stuff through the loading dock which closes at 4, unless they feel
Like leaving before 4 in which case you're out of luck.

The menu that I was ordering from confused me a bit because I was wondering, where were all the Greek items such as pastitsio, moussaka, saganaki, bakalava, and spanakopita?!?!? 

People have said that the menu was downsized but the only thing I could find that was greek was Gyros, Falafel and dolmades and souvlaki and I went with the Gyro. The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old. The fries were on a greasiness level of their own. I have never had such soggy fries.

She came up to our table after we were sitting here for 10 minutes, she didn't even say a word to us, just looked at my mom and myself as if we were just ready to order. Do they normally not greet people here ? Even if there was a language barrier, my mom speaks fluent Korean. She could at least tried to greet us. My water wasn't even refilled. I've been a server at numerous places , this isn't how businesses are handled. It was $40 dollars for lunch speical for 2 people and it didn't even taste good. Ugh!

Tm__mScF7mHjYm02aH51eA,"My boyfriend and I have been loyal patrons to Saigon Kitchen for some time now. Each time we go back, it gets better and better. There has not been a single dish we've tried that has been anything less than extraordinary. Like another reviewer here, I literally have to force myself to try something new because I like each dish that much, but each time I do I find a brand new favorite. My boyfriend is partial to the Dennis sandwich - a perfect blend of slightly spicy with fresh cilantro - and my favorite is the chicken pho. But recently, we tried the pork tenderloin special atop garlic noodles and it was outta-this-world delicious! 

Moreover, the staff here is truly spectacular. Personable, attentive, and full of great recommendations on what to try if you just can't decide. We've come multiple times during a lunch or dinner rush and they always seem to handle the hungry masses with ease.

It might be because we had a table upstairs in a reserved area where we got to dance by ourselves, enjoy the drinks and rest our feet a little. The layout is well done - so if you wanna mix into the crowd, there is a huge huge dance floor downstairs, and the music really rocks with lots of 80's (yeah I'm an 80's kid.) and less of R&B which gets sickening after you hear at any club you go.

I2L0yOB9FG7n8yPYN56-oQ,"A big letdown. I have been to the Ahwatukee location a handful of times and have had decent experiences. There was nothing decent about this experience. 
First, we arrived at about 635p and happy hour ends at 7. We did not anticipate getting there in time for happy hour, but we were so that was a bonus in my mind. However, the hostess said there would be a wait even though there were 2 empty tables and one empty booth within sight. After waiting for about 10 minutes, we were just about to ask what was wrong with the empty tables when she sat us at the very booth that had been sitting empty the whole time we were waiting. WTH?
The waitress asked for our drink order and my old lady asked if it was still happy hour prices, and the waitress said ""if it is before 7"". WTF? The answer is a yes or no. I checked my phone and said it was 650p, so is that yes?  Then I asked if they had Guinness on draft, since there were HH prices on import drafts. She said ""yes, but there's no specials on Guinness"". ""What about this list of HH prices?""  ""We don't do those anymore.""  ""So none of these prices are valid?""  ""Let me check""
As for the food, yawn. The wings were not nearly as good as what I have gotten at the Ahwatukee location. 
The Guinness did taste good though.  The old lady got a skinny Rita which was also a HH special, but they overcharged us for it. By that point, I was so sick of the servers attitude, I just paid it and took the difference out of her tip.
Needless to say, the next time we are looking for wings in this area, someone else is getting our business.",2.0

The good news was the Blackened Chicken Bowties.  A very flavourful dish and the pasta was nicely done to al dente.  Also a generous portion.
The bad news was the 'attempt' at their Herbed Brie Double Chicken. It was advertised as a double chicken breast however I got the leg and thigh of what looked like a cornish game hen.  The 'brie' portion was minimal and was over-whelmed with the red pepper sauce.  It looked great on the menu but what was delivered fell well short.

My husband and I, plus our two dogs, had just completed a 4 1/2 day move from San Diego, and this was to be our final hotel stay before we moved into the house. We booked this motel about a month in advance, and I had no qualms about it, because I've stayed in MANY Motel 6's and never had a bad experience-until now.

We knew as soon as we pulled up that this motel was not going to be great, but we were tired and just wanted to get out of the car. There were kids all over the place running and screaming without supervision, and more than one sketchy-looking trucker hanging around being creepy. I went inside and got our room key. The front desk at this location looks like its a family living room behind the front desk, and although the gentleman who checked me in was pleasant enough, I just had a bad feeling.

We got to our room, opened the door, and were just shocked. We had asked for a nonsmoking room, and even though it had a nonsmoking sign on it, it absolutely reeked of cigarettes. The beds were stained, sagging, and looked like they might be crawling with something. Besides the cigarette smell, there was some sort of other odor in the room; I can't put my finger on it. Musty, maybe. It was just bad, and as I said, I am not picky with motels at all. We decided that we just could not stay here.

Luckily there was a La Quinta across the streets that accepted dogs, so my husband went back inside to get a refund. He said there was no issue getting the refund, and it seemed like the man had done it frequently. The La Quinta was much better.

First rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. 
And here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. 
UM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. 
And it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out.

 We were seated quickly and the waitress was super nice and very helpful. The layout was nice, but from my seat, I was staring out the door to what I think was a patio, lots of sun to blind me, and I didn't see any sun shades. 
 We got the guacome to start. It was very authentic and tasted fresh and delicious. The chips were fresh and had a great flavor. 
 My wife had a Sangria. She thought it was a little watery.  But, not being a drinker, the alcohol snuck up a little. I had a chelada. The lime was a little overwhelming, but good. 
  I ordered the skirt steak. It was seasoned perfect and cooked awesome. I loved it. The mole sauce on side was great.  It came with one giant handmade tortilla. So wonderful. It rocked.

NWY4IaTBWYBOJRGbBLa9yQ,"AMAZED. I brought in a Topshop dress and my boyfriend' suit after a wedding had soiled both. I couldn't remember how I got all these random stains on my dress ( it was a fun night, okay??) but had little hope for the 120$ pale pink dress. I was bummed, but figured I would try to save it from the grease, blood and mysterious blue stains engrained in the thing. After dropping the items off at Elite, I went home hoping for the best. I got a call the next day in which a really nice lady asked for an extra day to get these tough stains out. I was psyched at the chance of getting back anything close to the new dress and told them they could have as long as they needed. To my extreme surprise, my dress is now good as new and my boyfriend's suit is immaculate with all of the items he had forgotten to removed carefully returned to me (including a yarmulka he had received from the wedding). And it was so cheap! I'm blown away. Awesome customer service to boot. The ONLY thing was a complete pain in the a** and was not at all the fault of this business was the parking lot. The valet service for the pub next door was ridiculous. I almost got in a wreck trying to get off the main road to pull into the parking lot which was blocked by empty parked cars in the middle of the road. Like 6 of them. Ridiculous.

 If you want to see a bunch of junky vendors and crap food, go to the million swap meets, Arizona has to offer...DONT GIVE THE STATE FAIR OF ARIZONA ONE DIME.

IN ADDITION,  I  did not see one water fountain but lots of water selling for $3.00 a bottle!!  Are you kidding me????  You would make a profit selling it for $1.00, because it was hot as hell on Oct. 13th!  I was so thirsty.

 I did not see a theme for the fair, the whole layout looked sloppy and thrown together.  No seating at all.   Food venues with the same food over and over again at Chop House prices for pig slop.

 The agricultural entries were limited to a plate of lemons!!!!   Where are the competitive growers??  One pavilion was dedicated to the arts and crafts, the youth art was in the basement of Veterans Stadium, (see how valuable the kids are?????)housing a shrunken, student art section.  

Did not see with photography entries, and the art was displayed, in the most ugly, disrespectful way, I have ever viewed...A very small homemade food and canning section. The area was filled in with dinosaurs.  Why?  Dunno.

Absolutely no representation of the diverse population, in Arizona, the Indian culture, wine growers, history of the state, travel or places to visit.. No free exhibits to enrich your understanding of Arizona.  

For example, with 380 golf courses in the Valley and not one sponsor????How about putt putt golf for kids and adults???NO FREE EXHIBITS AT ALL!!!  Who is running the fair????

No sponsorships to make your entry fee even worthwhile?? You pay to get in, then pay and pay, with nothing in return???

The animal section had poultry, sheep, swine, goats, cattle etc.  Absolutely no signs describing anything and more diverse animals would have been great.  The geese had no food or water and were very vocal about it!

No informational exhibits educational information present.  The Fair is a glorified swap meet with bad food, and carnival rides.  

I sent a 10 page recommendation for Fair Improvement , years ago, with suggestions on how to improve the fair. They obviously blew it off and ignored me....and it only got worse!!!

 It is obvious that no one in Arizona, who runs the fair, gives a crap about preserving the history, or promoting education...

They care about bad politicians, fast money, building homes, (even though there is no demand) and overseeing a failed education system. Then, some rag tag state employees throw together a really bad carnival and shove that in our faces....""screw you taxpayers, take our trash or leave it!!

ZGIK-I9LNwb3_foKT5q3mQ,"Disclaimer: I'm not a club type person - so please take this review with a grain of salt. 

Our company had a holiday/cocktail party here.  If I were to assess the entire event, it would have been 1.5 stars, however I don't know how much of it was the planning committee's fault and how much of it was the venue's fault.  

What I liked:  The space was very nice.  It has some comfy couches and is very clean and hip. The music was pretty good as well.

What I disliked: I'm sure our company would have told them we were planning to be there from 6:30-11:30 and we wanted a cocktail party.  If it's a cocktail party, there definitely should be music, but it was blaring all night.  This would be great if it were a bunch of university students clubbing, but the DJ should have thought it through that it is a COMPANY party and people want to mingle for the first few hours.  At least give us 2 hours until 8:30 to hear ourselves talk and then you can blast the music up at 8:30-9 so people can start dancing.  Another dislike was the infrequency of the food.  I probably had about four bites all night at the venue and I was there from 6:30 to 10.  Another coworker and I got so frustrated, we left at 7:30 to grab some real food.  I don't know if this was our company being cheap, but my coworker said he attended a b-day party here and ran into the same situation.  

My last and final dislike was the food.  While I thought the meat was pretty good, why did everything have to be served on a chip, cracker or just be fries?  You could have at least served it on bread.  

Verdict: Seems like a good clubbing place, but doesn't seem like a great dinner place or to hold ""professional"" parties.",2.0
2viWzCLJfwrN5rguD8u_cQ,"TL;DR: The first zip line is a lie! 

We went in the mid-afternoon on a Thursday, thinking that it probably wouldn't be too busy in the middle of the week when most people are at work. We arrived on time, filled out our forms quickly but then had to wait around for 10-15 mins while they waited for other people to show up. Finally the instructor came and got our ""group"" together and went through a long speech teaching us about the equipment, how to use it, and how to stay safe. Just as he was finishing up, another family that arrived late were added to our group. The instructor started over from the beginning and we had to listen to the entire speech again. The instructor then had us demonstrate several procedures we just learned, culminating by zipping down a test zip line that is about six feet off the ground. I was not happy to find out that they consider this zip line #1 of 5. The ""zip line"" is a joke, it takes about three seconds to descend three feet. Calling this a zip line is practically false advertising. We waited for the entire group to finish the test jump, listened some more, and were finally free to go. It had probably been 45 mins at that point since we arrived.

My friend and I jumped to the front of the line and were able to get right into the course for #2. It was the first time I'd done this so I was slower than my friend but we still managed to keep up a good pace without much effort. The climb was fun and the obstacles were interesting if not overly challenging. The landing strips are not well designed, they slope upwards at a crazy angle and trip you but the wood chips are relatively soft so we didn't mind. The zip was fairly long and the view of the forest was pretty cool. I was actually starting to think that all that waiting around was paying off.

That feeling lasted until we got to zip line #3. There was a half dozen people waiting below the first tree and at least as many already up in the trees on the course. This wasn't my group, who was coming up behind us, we had already run into the group before us. The instructors tell you that you can ""play through slower groups, just like in golf"", and that's true in theory but it's false in practice. You can only have three people on each platform, one person on each crossing, kids can't be more than one crossing away from a parent, and lines form and platforms fill up. You can't just skip in front of everyone who is in line, and you can't tell people to stop and stay where they are so you can move to the next platform. You can skip around people now and then but expect to get stuck frequently. So, back to the story, after all that waiting we basically did one zip line, then got in line to start waiting again. Now I was ready to ask for my money back at this point. We'd been there a long time and had spent very little time having any fun. After failing to find any employee anywhere, I took a long walk back to the office to complain, and they gave us permission to skip straight to four. We proceeded to station #4 which, thankfully, only had a few people on it, well ahead of us.

We completed four then we followed the path to #5 which led to a tree with no way to climb.  We were very confused and wanted to ask someone but there was not an employee anywhere within sight or earshot. After blowing our whistles for about five minutes, finally one of the instructors came walking slowly up the path and informed us with annoyance that #5 was closed. He acted like we should have known even though no one told us and there were no signs posted.  I wish they'd told us when we got there that 1 out of 5, actually let's be honest here, that 1 out of 4 zip lines were out of commission. We could have rescheduled for another day.

So the instructor tells us that since #5 was closed, we could repeat one of the other zips. So we went back to #3 where the last people from our original group were still waiting to go up on three so we got in line. We finally got up and were able to go around one family but almost immediately got stuck behind another family. After we zipped three, we went to redo four but four was now full with another group and so was two. We decided to redo three instead and walked back over to it. We got up quickly this time but quickly got stuck behind another family.  We finished the zip and that was it, we were done.  We were fairly disappointed.

So let's recap. The first zip line is a lie. The other courses are short, but still frequently congested. The only reason you don't finish the entire thing quickly is because you're inevitably stuck waiting behind people.  This says to me that there are too many people on the course.  They seem understaffed; you can never find an employee except near the office.  At $57 a person, more than the cost of a Cedar Point ticket, you should be getting a premium experience; this isn't it.  Save your money for something better.",2.0
WxLkunz_NNDyikzJnEOd-w,We went searching for a good burger place for our last evening in Las Vegas and ran across Gus Fieri's place in the LINQ...what a disappointment...I new we were in trouble when the server asked if medium well was ok.  She frowned at the possibility of cooking them medium rare...(a must in my eye for a premium $20 burger)...so we settled for medium for both burgers.  We ordered the Original and the Mac and Cheese burger.  The Original came out medium and the Mac and Cheese was well done.  The burger patty was maybe 4oz...where's the beef??...definitely more toppings than burger patty and served with warm not hot trio fries.  The flavors were ok on both but definitely a $10 burger at best!  The Trash Can Brisket Nachos were ordered as well and were definitely better than the burgers.  The cheese sauce on the nachos was a bit bland but overall fairly tasty.  Not worth a second visit and definitely a poor reflection of Gus Fieri in my opinion...a big disappointment!,3.0

They start with four sauces, each packed with different but well balanced flavor. For example, their mango hot sauce doesn't just bring spice but also sweetness. You spend the meal pairing each bite of food with the four sauces to obtain the maximum tastebud adventure. The food itself is purposefully varied in both texture and taste. I can't tell you which bite was my favorite. Maybe the tender mussels cooked in coconut sauce, the crunch of the fried chicken adobo dipped in the mango hot sauce, the lettuce wrap with lechon and slaw as a fresh palate cleanser, the sweet char of the brocollini, the fall off the bone pork rib in a sweet sticky sauce, that creamy center of the devilled egg, the subtle sweetness of the cornbread.... you get the idea.

4FR4Fwe2lpOcNITX87WDNw,"I am reviewing this place solely in the category of buffets. As far as buffets go, the Bellagio is the best. I've been to a lot of buffets both in Las Vegas and other states. I am rather fond of buffets as I'm a big eater. The food choice is excellent and some of the food is great even as a stand alone dish. I agree with some of the other reviews that there has been somewhat of a decline over the last 10 years, but again as far as buffets go, it's still the best. I've tried the Wynn, Bacchanal at Caesar's and pretty much every other buffet on and off the strip and the quality/taste of the Bellagio buffet is still the best. The Bacchanal has Bellagio beat as far as the sheer number of choices and the Wynn is comparable, but I still give the nod to the Bellagio. I'm actually not a big fan of the crab legs, but I found that the taste/quality of crab legs are pretty much the same at all the top $ buffets. Bacchanal's crab legs were the mostly frozen, although the quality was fine, with the Bellagio and the Wynn pretty much the identical. I enjoyed the meat station at the Bellagio the best with Bacchanal meat station having the most choices, but lacking the quality. If I had to rate the Bellagio compared to other stand-alone restaurants, obviously it would not be 5 stars, but I think it's only fair to keep restaurants in categories. The price is around $40.00 so it's expensive for a buffet but not unreasonable compared to other high-end buffets and certainly not that expensive compared to other restaurants, where you could easily spend that much per person at the Cheesecake factory with apps, entrees and desserts.",5.0

1/5 for the staff/office
4/5 for Dr. Rebecca Tyre....I figure doc should carry more weight than staff...

Why 1/5 for the staff/office?
1. Staff is very unfriendly. REALLY unfriendly. I read some poor reviews before going in and I thought, well, I'll kill them with kindness. Entirely unsuccessful. Front desk staff pretty much avoided any sort of eye contact, and will flat out refuse to talk to you until they call you up...in fact, I had to go up three times over 1.5 hrs to find out they were having issues with my insurance. 

2. The wait is INSANE. I had a 9AM appointment. How does a 9AM appointment run over 1.5 hrs late?

3. Seriously, are they not allowed to smile?

There is minimal explanation of what happens. They also get very annoyed with you when you are unable to read their mind and herd  yourself to the correct cubicle to find the correct PA/nurse.

4/5 for Dr. Tyre.
The interaction with Dr. Tyre was surprisingly pleasant. She was friendly and comforting, which I feel is an important characteristic in an OB/GYN. The only reason I am taking 1 star off is because I was recommended a redo of a certain test in 6 mo to confirm something...which seemed completely reasonable...until my friends that are practicing OB/GYNs elsewhere told me that's really not the standard of care. I understand and definitely appreciate the sentiment to rule out certain things...but I'm also a firm believer in following standard of care and avoiding excessive testing.

What an incredible opportunity to volunteer and make a difference without the commitment of adopting - an opportunity I hope to seek out soon. I spent approximately 4 hours at the shelter, and adopted the only pup I asked to interact with. All the staff members/volunteers I encountered were cordial and helpful. The process was easy and far more affordable than purchasing from a breeder.

eqzZXiAX1zXQ0cw1fPXPxA,"EDIT:

I heard that some improvements had been made, so I went back and gave it another try.  This time, it was fabulous.  The cakes were moist, tender, and really tasty.  Prices still high, but this time it seemed worth it.  They have lowered the prices for a dozen cupcakes and dropped the box charge.  They also took cereal off the menu.

Minus 1 star because of the prices and because the gelato that comes with the $6 pairing wasn't that great.  The serving was also really small.  I'll skip the gelato and stick with a cupcake and a nice glass of milk when I go back.  I'd also prefer a sweeter, less greasy frosting, but that's a personal taste thing and It's probably not fair to fault them for my personal preference.

Overall, I was very impressed with the changes.  It made for a really nice evening to sit at the outdoor bar and enjoy a great cupcake on a warm spring evening, and I look forward to doing so again soon.

*******
I REALLY wanted to love this place.  I went in a few days after they opened and was disappointed to see that they are very overpriced.  But I didn't let that get me down.  I figured the prices must be reflective of the quality, and I got ready to sample what I expected would be some phenomenal cupcakes.  

To my dismay, these expensive cupcakes are really not that good.  The few I brought home for everyone to sample were extremely dry and bland.  The texture reminded me of the free hunk of cake you get for your birthday at cheesy chain restaurants.

I'd had very high hopes for the salted caramel, but there was no hint of salt and the caramel element tasted like sugar that had been burnt, not caramelized.  The Red Velvet had a hint of cream cheese flavor in the frosting, but wasn't very sweet and had no chocolate flavor.  The high point was the strawberry balsamic, which was a nice combination of flavors but, like the others, very poorly executed.  It was really just a plain, dry, flavorless cupcake with some pretty decent strawberry frosting (which I actually liked very much) and a drizzle of thick vinegar.  Overall though, I'm sorry to report that  I've had better cupcakes from a box.

Speaking of boxes, if you want one to carry your cupcakes home in, It'll cost you $1.  With as much as they're charging for the cupcakes, you'd think they'd give you something to carry them home in.  Nope.  That's extra.  Insult to injury, if you will.

I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again in a few months to give them a chance to get into the swing of things and, with any luck, turn out a better cupcake.  My hope is that the strawberry balsamic frosting is an indicator of a potential that they will reach once they get past the first few weeks.  Unfortunately, I don't know that they'll be around in a few months and I'm also not sure that I'd be willing to pay their insane prices even if the cupcakes were to improve substantially.",4.0

Walking in, it is generally expected for you to seat yourself - after you overcome the awkwardness of glares from the bar patrons in the back. Service was generally slow, leaving us to scramble for menus and wait a few minutes before even being greeted. 

I had ordered the Cali Bene - eggs benedict with avocado, tomato, spinach with a side of home fries. One of my friends stuck to her favorite of chicken fingers (with the sole intention that the ranch was made in house). While one of my other friends, wavering with indecision, chose the Redondo Beach Egg Salad Sandwich with a side of Chicken Tortilla soup. The food came out promptly, so I'll give the Beach Cafe that. However, taste was lacking. Hollandaise sauce soaked half the plate, which normally I do not mind. However, it was so salty that I attempted to dissect the parts of my benedict that had not been attacked with sodium. After three minutes, all hope was lost - my Cali Bene was fairly inedible. The home fries were decent, better in comparison to the salt fest next to it. As for my friends' food, the chicken fingers were good (not a difficult accomplishment). My other friend quickly demolished her soup (as much as I love brunch, so has the same affinity for soup). However, her egg salad sandwich was primarily two pieces of bread with a thin layer of egg salad. I took a bite, and was unimpressed - my school's dining hall has done better. 

What really set in my apathy towards this place was the lack of cordiality demonstrated by both the staff and the longstanding patrons. After a couple had left the restaurant, one of the staff members had engaged in openly mocking and criticizing them. The heckling riled the customers she had been talking to, and soon spread like wildfire. My party felt fairly uncomfortable afterwards - both out of shock for their lack of propriety as well as the fear that our departure would result in insult.

If you know me, you know I'm a sucker for Al Pastor Tacos, so I just had to stop and try at least one. After finishing it, I would not agree with their claim, but the tacos still weren't half bad. Here's the run down:

1) As others have said here, the service is not all that good. The guy in the truck cooking and preparing the food seemed to be working his tail off, but the lady running the cash register acted like she really didn't want to be there. Every order took forever: it almost seemed like she was moving super slow on purpose. When my order came up and the cook rang the bell, she didn't even so much as blink, but kept doing what looked like checking hand written orders with a paper that came out of the credit card machine. Two more orders came up, but she just kept doing whatever she was doing. Finally, after a long time, we all got our food, but I'm really not sure why she couldn't have taken the 10 seconds to move the plates from the truck window to the order table. 

2) The meat and pineapple was yummy (yes, the al pastor tacos come with PINEAPPLE!), but the tortillas were pretty dry and didn't taste super fresh. This might have partially been because they sat for so long once the cook finished, but I think they were just not made that day or even the day before. Big props, however, on all the condiments. If you can't find a condiment you like here, it probably doesn't exist.

The owners (who work the counter and cook the food) really take pride in what they serve you! I will drive an extra 10 minutes to T&T, rather than go to my local chain restaurant. I had the Carne Asada Chimichanga, the meat was tender and juicy and the portion was huge! We also got some tacos and nachos. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced! Will be back as often as I can. Thank you for a new favorite place to go in Las Vegas, Tostadas & Tacos!",5.0
tnVel5IJazzNeirlCJzYtQ,"As soon as we got here I think I downed rubbing alcohol that some random guy that friends of friends met gave me. He says it was vodka, but I think it was rubbing alcohol. Needless to say I guess I was disinfected through and through. 

Then the guy's friend asks ""Hey we've been waiting a long time. What took you guys so long.""

Seeing my friend dead silent, I decided to be nice and try to answer, after all they have just provided us with a cleansing. ""Oh we just flew in, I hope you weren't waiting too long were you?""

""I've been waiting all my life for you to come along.""

That's when I basically laugh in his face. ""Seriously? You really tried to use that line? Really?"" 

""Well I had to try it.""

""Oh no, you really didn't."" I continue to laugh, and he disappears not so mysteriously back into the crowd. 

Apparently I've been told Lindsay Lohan frequents here. I can't see why. The music is TERRIBLE, with dead stops in the middle of the sets, and very poor song selection. Then the lowlifes there think that if they buy you drinks you have do pony up something, and most are too drunk to notice that they haven't supplied drinks, so then lots of shoving was required on my part. I would rather buy my own drink than to talk to people who are shady shade.

Nevertheless I still had fun because of the company I was with. Best nerd moment ever was when a friend busted out the iPhone and spun it like how you'd spin a glow stick. I was cracking up so hard.

The greens that came with the southern combo were seasoned to perfection, the Mac and cheese was seasoned well, cheesy and delicious.

It feels like sometimes the spices aren't cooked all the way into the food, if that makes sense.  Because of the inconsistency I would give it 3 stars, but I bumped it up to 4 for those fabulous times.

D6WxFAs1BDBQoo_ksK3SmA,"Although I wouldn't consider myself uber fit, I do enjoy exercising through different types of workouts from Bikram Yoga to resistance training and hybrid boot camp type workouts.

Doing both martial arts and boot camps in the past I was expecting a challenging but not necessarily a killer workout.  I was wrong!  

Although boot camp type workouts are often challenging, I feel the classes are often watered down a bit to the level of the overall level of the group.  However, at 1 on 1 boxing, if the instructors feel like you can do more, they push you to do more.  If you the 10 pound medicine ball is too light, they'll give you the 12 or 15.  If you are slacking on punches, they get on you to punch harder.  I haven't had a workout yet that I walked away feeling unchallenged.

What I do like is that the workouts vary from class to class.  Some days it's all leg work (which I hate, but usually means that's what I need to work on) to boxing drills to medicine ball work to old school skip rope, running and sit ups.  A big plus for me is that there is no cursing - including the music that's played.  I hate cursing and the disparaging comments that often come along with it.  Being vulgar doesn't make me feel more like a fighter.

My only con is this.  I would like them to offer another option for their classes.  It seems it's just one deal with $99 for unlimited classes.  If they had a punch card type system at a reasonable price I would go for it.",4.0

It was also accompanied by a visit from the manager who spoke with us a while and gave a proper background on how it was prepped and more information on the idea of marrow itself.

Monica scheduled to have Angel come out to give me an estimate.  Angel was a no-show.  Had to call back into the office the next day.  Monica made arrangements to have Angel come back out that night.  I couldn't be there and had Angel meet and speak with my dad since he knew what I was wanting.  Angel told him that repairs could be made and called me after this meeting.  I then proceeded to call the office 2 days later (which was a Friday) and spoke with Monica.  She made arrangements to have Angel come out the following Monday to do the written estimates.  The appointment was for 5pm as was the 1st appointment that Angel no showed.  Again, Angel was a no show.  I was home until 5:40pm.  Angel then proceeded to call me at 6:30pm after I had left to run errands to tell me he was there at my place and would start measuring for my replacement.  THIS is NOT what was discussed.  Repairs are much different than replacement.  Also, what the heck happened to my 5pm appointment??  He told me that he was across town working on another project.  And, was told by Monica to by at my place between 5-6pm.  So, he couldn't call me to let me know he was running behind??? 5-6pm is not 6:30.  This is not the arrangement that I made and was told by Monica my appointment time was at 5pm.  Monica proceeded to call me the next day to ask for my e-mail address - which I already had to give when filling out their on-line information - so she could send over my estimate.

Hands down the best organic grocery/household/beauty product location in downtown Toronto. And who doesn't enjoy a trip to Kensington for the flavour if nothing else? But back to Essences...huge grocery section: frozen and fresh vegetables, prepared meals, grains, coffee & teas, breads, bulk foods, dairy - or non-dairy dairy if you're vegan/lactose, canned, crackers, you name it, its there.

The household section carries everything eco-friendly you could imagine from dryer sheets to soaps to paper products and cleaners. 

There also my favourite part of the store...the beauty section. WIth a huge variety of different eco-friendly brands. Vitamins, toothpaste, creams, lotions, perfumes, of all varieties. If you've been eco-friendly long (of not so long) you know it can be difficult to find a brand right off the bat that you love. The staff is very knowledgeable about all the products and is more than happy to make a recommendation. 

The layout is dense - they make the most of their space and there's always someone to gracefully work around in the aisles so patience can be a virtue when getting to your favourite things but in this eco-friendly place, people tend to be, well, friendly.

I cannot say enough great things about Essece Of Life - which I just usually call ""Essences"". The price is a bit below average for most of these products - I've been to ""Natural"" stores before and seen the items I buy priced for 3 times what I pay at Essences.

It took them three full days to get back to me with the diagnostic test results, which cost me $30 (non-refundable). In the diagnostic results, they claimed that my hard drive was failing and needed to be replaced for $140 and to recover data that's an extra $120, they also recommended a battery replacement for $134. I didn't have time to wait for them to order a new hard drive and have it shipped, so I decided to bring my laptop back to the local apple store and let them take a look.
The local apple store ran a diagnostic test, fixed my laptop and installed the new system for me within 2 hours for $0. That's right, $0!
Knowing that the Illini Union Tech Zone carries mostly apple products, it's honestly quite surprising to see that their technicians don't seem to be as familiar with the products as they should be? And they're giving poor, costly advice to students.
I wouldn't go back there again. BTW, I asked the apple technician and he said it would only be $100 to recover data.

I was assigned to them by my home warranty company, and I will be filing a serious complaint with them and the BBB.  I was told to take the cash out option from the warranty company for the part and then they would do the work and I could just pay them directly.  After I received the cash out and called to schedule the appointment I was told that I need to replace the entire pool pump system and that would cost an additional $400 and that there was an electrical problem and that it would cost additional money as well.  

I was then told that the salt cell that I need is no longer on the market, even though I was able to find them on Amazon.  This is the reason that I am STILL trying to discuss my options with the tech who ACTUALLY SAW MY POOL AND THE PUMP.

This is the only place in Arizona where I have eaten tempura the way it's supposed to be done (when you see tempura shrimp that's uniformly round around the edges, that's a no-no.) They have takoyaki and the normal Japanese comfort foods that I have come to love, all cooked by a Japanese elderly couple. Prices are great, portions are enough for you to take some home, and food comes out quick since you're likely to to be the only one in there unless you hit lunch hour where all the MCC kids come trolling over. 

They have sushi but I didn't try it and in an establishment like this where it's a little more barren and run down, I will truthfully say that I'm a little scared to try their fish, but I will probably do so in the future and update this post. Definitely worth a try!",4.0

Especially non-casino, non-smoking ones with good shower heads, giant bathtubs, full kitchens, free wi-fi, great pillows, and a shaded balcony so the paler among us can still be outside without getting toasted. Because really, charred marshmallow isn't a great look outside of a S'more. The staff was A+, quickly handling our requests for cooking supplies and more, while the valet parking was an extra bonus that made me feel fairly fancy. The pool was nicely maintained, and poolside drink service efficient and friendly, despite the rudeness of the patrons I encountered inside the bar. 

This is, apparently, a hotel that folks like to get married at, so maybe be prepared for pool closures and some cheering/chanting/thumping bass late at night. This should not be a problem unless you are a grandma like me, and even then a quick call to the hotel management managed to placate both revelers and guests alike. Again, great staff!

I work in customer service, and have worked in customer service for about 20 years. Customer perception is reality. The girls at the hostess area/computer/thing just don't seem to have any desire to assist. My wife and I had a reservation tonight for 7:45. Our plans changed and we arrived early, around 6. We asked if we could be seated earlier, and they said no problem. Here it is, 7:05, and plenty of people have walked in and been seated after we came in. I walked up around 6:30, and they said it would be a ""couple"" minutes. As my wife and I sit here and see the empty clean tables, that have been empty and clean since we arrived, I myself am beginning to wonder if we slipped through the cracks or something. I must have forgot to take off my invisibility cloak or something. All 4 of these ladies are just standing there, talking and chatting, and help more people as they come in, and get seated. Needless to say, this is a pretty long review because I have lots of free time while I wait to be seated with my wife. At this point, looks like we are going to be seated at our original reservation time. Arrogant Butcher, you may have lost a loyal customer......
I started off this review with 4 stars, and have since dropped it to 2, as I'm sitting here, waiting to be seated.....
UPDATE:
Just moved it back to 4 stars, thanks to Alec (spelling) one of the managers, who personally came by our table because he saw this review on Yelp. I have to say, being a manager myself, it means a lot to face an upset customer, especially while they are still in the restaurant. Kudos to him, and the ownership for having him as a manager.

We waited approximately 15-20minutes and were given a super warm welcome by the lady taking the names... It was a pleasure to meet her, she was friendly and full of life! Despite being very busy, they really have excellent service and attention. For the service alone, I would definitely return. Our waiter understood our special meal requests without us even having to explain and immediately knew how to amend our orders to suit us! Very impressive!

My husband and I both ordered from the Monteregie section (it was super difficult to nail it down to one selection as the menu is never ending!

These Fries were so overdone, charred and dried out that they were like those dry straws you buy in a bag or can. How can they mess up what every other location has brilliantly delivered?

I walked out of the theater feeling inspired and amazed that we humans are so easily amused. The props seemed so simple. Big blowup inanimate objects, neon lights and balloons. It just never gets old- if it's done right.

The food is consistently great - they make a lot of things from scratch, which I appreciate so much. Coffee is also great. The service isn't the fastest, but it's not a 'grab breakfast to go' kind of place for us. We really love sitting in the cozy atmosphere and having a lazy breakfast.

givZqjwQch1VMN05onp20Q,"While the quality of the ingredients are pretty good, and the presentation of the food is pretty good, this place just falls down for a couple major problems.

1. Speed. Went there for breakfast recently and the it took entirely too long to get my food.  I'm trying to sneak out of work to grab a quick sandwich and instead it turns into my lunch break.  There were no other customers in the place ---- the name of the game is to get people in and out. ESPECIALLY DOWNTOWN!!

2. Generosity of the ingredients.  The roast beef sandwich was all bread and very little meat.  I don't mind paying $9 for a sandwich, but it better be good and fill me up. They had only one or two measly slices of roast beef.

Tons of parking, clean bathrooms, you can watch whatever you want on TV, pinball, big patio, and you feel safe.  Weirdos every now and then, but where isn't there?

T5dE90hplvP7UWQqYxYMTg,"I want to preface this review by admitting I didn't want to come here and I don't like chain restaurants like this, but someone we were going out to eat with really wanted to go here.

The restaurant was crazy busy and it's huge, so it was really loud.  The tables are like a faux-marble type material, so when the bus-boys were setting the tables and throwing down the utensils repeatedly, the sounds got real old fast.

We went here for lunch  and got the nachos with chicken as our app.  There was literally 5 random pieces of chicken on the nachos and it was gross and the flavoring was super sweet, which is weird to put on nachos.  The chips were saturated in grease and I'm not really sure why...

I ordered the Monterrey Burger to be cooked medium.  It was burnt/charred in some spots and completely brown throughout the burger.  It wasn't that great.  The arugula it came with was put on top of the hot burger, so it was all wilted and not the best consistency.  I only ate half my burger.  

We all got cheesecake since we felt like we kind of had to.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it fell short IMO.  The cheesecake itself was delicious! However, it was covered in thick chocolate cake and it was so rich - I didn't eat that part.

Overall, it was pretty much what I expected from a place like this.",2.0
YfYWwFxrN53jDpq6atlxPA,"Cut me a little slack - I'm a transplant to Arizona from Sonoma County which is probably one of the most eclectic, snobbiest, liberal, expensive places on EARTH to live *but* at the same time, I was never short of quaint, cool, funky little hang-outs.  

Hob Nobs reminded me of something I'd find in Sonoma County but without the feeling that anybody was looking down their nose at me or the hippy serving me hadn't washed their hair since they lived in the haight-ashbury district in the 70's.   The staff was nice, cleanly, knowledgeable of the ingredients (all the sauces & mayo are made from scratch), and were smart enough to get my order right.  That's a HUGE plus.   

I had never been here when it was the Willo House so I have no reference to the extent of the remodeling but - as it is now - the interior is very nice with beautiful wood floors, fun paint colors on the walls, artwork everywhere featuring local artists, and several different rooms all with a different feel where you can hide & chill, be amoung people, or even seat 8 or 10 and hold a meeting.  I'm with Kenny B... I could sit here for hours and check out the eye-candy.

I had a spinach salad with chicken, mandarin oranges, and candied pecans.  It was a good salad - my only complaint was that the chicken on the salad was actually chicken salad.  I was expecting grilled chicken (no mayo) but it was still very yummy.

My b/f had a spicy chicken salad sandwich which - to me - was too spicy but the sweet little side of cole-slaw contrasted the fire and cooled it down a bit.  I probably wouldn't order it again... but the selection of sandwiches drew my attention enough to already have picked out my ""next time I'm gonna have...""

So yes, for me... there will be a next time.  However, I'm giving it a 4 because I agree with most reviewers... it's a bit overpriced.  It was $22 for lunch for 2 people (a salad, a sandwich, and 2 drinks).  It's fine for once-in-a-while lunches but too high to be a regular lunch resource.  

I know it's odd for a soda-fountain to be found in a coffee house but let's face it... Most coffee houses serve coffee & specialty drinks (along with a semi-fresh bagel or scone or biscotti...).  Hob Nobs is not *just* a coffee house.  The food here was well planned and prepared... not just an after-thought.  It's really more of a cafe / house than a coffee house.",4.0

I was surprised that they poured the balsamic dressing onto my salad (not mixing it) as opposed to having it on the side like other restaurants. 

Atmosphere: The decoration was nice and the place had a relaxing atmosphere. It was clean overall.

Don Bluth himself (yes, he is the famous animator of ""An American Tail"" and others and founded this theatre,) and he was so pleasant and it was honor to share this small space with him.  The show was the hilarious comedy ""Boeing Boeing,"" about a businessman who lives near Orly Field in Paris and has three fiances, all of them flight attendants from three different national airlines.  They each think they are the only fiance and he spends a lot of time balancing air travel charts to make sure they don't find out about each other.

And what better time to do it but at 8:00 pm, Monday night when the streets are empty and where Laundromats are basically all mine.  Following the allure of the neon yellow and blue sign I return once again to my favourite get your clothing clean hang out Oh Henry's Laundromat & Dry Cleaners on 18th Avenue SW.  Having convenient daily hours of 8 am to 10 pm, Oh Henry's is the best place to be to relax to an orchestra of humming washers and dryers, and to be serviced by helpful and effervescent staff.  This establishment has been around for more than 12 years according to the lady working there. For a mere 3 dollars and a handful of odd quarters I can always count on getting a double load of laundry done.  At every visit my clothing turns out consistently clean and the dryers do a great job of drying as well.  

A line of 70s vinyl brown chairs line the waiting room area facing a 40 inch television where ""Dances With the Stars"" is just about to begin, the lady there returns to the television to increase the volume yet for the third time asking me where Cheryl is?   I shrug my shoulders and smile because I see that this is her favourite part of the day, the closing of the night.  In this last hour is when she can concentrate on cleaning the day's residue of lint and single socks to the slaughtering of the Dances With the Stars judges.  I am now folding my second load of clothing, and notice the hand sharpied prices of pop, chips and the odd candy bars if you so need to nibble on something to pass the time.  Certificates line one wall of the establishment citing it as the ""Best Laundromat in the City of Calgary"".  Looks like Oh Henry's has claimed this prize for 8 years of its more than 12 years' incarnation.  Worthy of this merit, I must say, I always feel incredibly relaxed when I come here, and can always count on a random conversation with the local yokels and a very clean establishment.

 If you need clean laundry, ironing or drying cleaning done then this warm and modest place is the place to come. I hope Oh Henry's continues on for another more than 12 years to come.

I have done many spinning classes that don't do all that nonsense and felt like I got a far better (and safer) workout and that actually feel more like real cycling.

I ordered the squid ink pasta and my girlfriend ordered the scallops. The portions were small and the scallops were extremely salty.

Both were very good and not overly sweet.

CByR0CEt_x4kCOYstF5lDw,"I don't know if this is the correct PODS location, but this comment is about the entire PODS company, not a specific location.

The whole notion of loading all your belongings into a box and then having the box shipped to the city you're moving to is brilliant and simple...unless you're dealing with PODS. These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, ""Oh yeah. The container arrived last week."" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.
Next was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.
And then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.
My brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.
Bottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.",1.0
Bboh7XPU-p8mrNYdH8OYsA,"Timing is everything. And because of the movie I really wanted to see, along with everyone else, it was really busy. Which I don't understand why we had to purchase our tickets at the concession stand while the ticket desk was CLOSED!!!

We waited in line for 30-minutes to purchase tickets because the line was moving very slow as people were also making decisions on purchasing food and waiting for it.  Now of course, we could purchase our tickets online, but when we checked, the show we wanted to see was practically sold out. And just for the heck of it, we wanted to double check with someone;  which didn't changed. We ended up not watching the movie and left.

Plain and simple, this comes down to operations management that should know better that on a major movie opening weekend, like Star Wars, you need a fully staffed team to ensure efficiency and comfort of your customers. The reason why? Because there are plenty of options, we're taking our business elsewhere.

The earliest reservation I could make online was for 9:45 pm on a Saturday and we were out of there in 35 minutes! I would recommend making a reservation as they were a lot of people waiting for tables on our way out.

The food came out as it was prepared and they timed it perfectly so my husband and I each had a plate in front of us. The tacos were just so good - juicy meat, perfectly seasoned sauces, the right amount of messiness. I'm so in love with these tacos.

My ranking from what I tried this visit: beef cheek (juicy and flavourful), campechano (I love chicharon), pescado (perfectly deep fried fish, salty sauces) and the sope without meat (kind of whatever except for the nice soft, doughy base). My husband said the barbacoa was his favourite but he didn't order the beef cheek so what does he know? :P

We ordered two cocktails - pina mojito and spicy margarita - and then shared them because each was good and went well with some tacos over others. The pina mojito goes well with the lamb tacos and is as equally refreshing as the spicy margarita (yes, it's SPICY).

With two cocktails, seven tacos and one sope the bill with tip was around $80.

Chicken and Mash ($14) - Braised chicken, red wine mushrooms, pearl onions and bacon with a side of buttered potato puree. This was the one thing on the menu I couldn't wait to try. It's Chef Rachel's twist on Coq Au Vin. Seeing this dish arrive at the table, it looked presented well and I couldn't wait to dig in. The potatoes are made with 50 percent butter and tasted so effing delicious! If you order anything here, order the mashed potatoes! The chicken was served in a  dish that had no red wine sauce in it. I as well my friends agreed that this dish was lacking the sauce and was dry with out it. I asked our server for some of the red wine sauce to pour over the chicken and it made such a huge difference! I did get a free sangria with this meal which was a great deal however it didn't taste that great. 

Strawberry and Champagne Pancakes ($8) - These are dutch baby style pancakes. The price is very fair, but the way these tasted left us all needing a drink just to swallow each bite. Too crispy on the outside and still somewhat raw in the center. 

Salted Caramel Budino ($6) - Caramel toffee, vanilla custard and crunchy fleur de sel. Though not as good as the now closed DOCG, this one will do just fine. We also got some type of apple strudel (also $6) and we all pretty much enjoyed the desserts more than the actual food.

- food was good, coffee was good

The weird:
- my grilled cheese had meat in it, despite it having a green ""V"" next to the description and no indication it'd have meat in it?  Perhaps they green ""V"" means it could become vegetarian (as this symbol was also next to a food item with salmon listed in it), but they should still list meat if it'll be present
- prices were ASTRONOMICAL.  Bill came to $50 and we didn't really eat anything and had no alcohol.  Also: no Caesars :( just Mimosas  (for $8.50!!!!)  Each serving for mains were tiny, and so you basically had to order a side, which made mains run $20

After the usual 3-4 pints of cheap lager, we get to talking about the love hate relationship with math-rock band Tortoise;  I hate them and everyone else loves them.  Pretty soon a dead ringer for Jerry Stiller in full boating regalia joins in. ""You guys like Chicago? You should check out Wayne Cochran and the CC Riders. A Chicago cover band!"" ""We saw them back in the 70's at the Horseshoe. We all went backstage and did a pile of blow.  He went back onstage and we danced all night!"" 

Huh?

The night continued as our ""guest"" kept moaning about how he missed his yacht. How if you ever ""do the deed, ALWAYS-WEAR- A- SAFE!"" (fist pounding the table for each syllable) and again, about how he misses having a  yacht.

I got a combo with a jerked chicken quesadilla, a pile of the red jade chicken, pork fried rice and refried beans, and I wasn't disappointed with any of it. Jerked chicken was REALLY spicy, but damn good. Outstanding blend of food. It transported well (took it to-go) and tasted just as good the next day after 2 minutes in the microwave.

While waiting for our order, these two guys came in and started taking pictures posing with the autographed poster of Guy Fieri and checking out all of the news clippings on the wall.

After looking at a not too large list of wines by the glass we told the bar tender what we wanted. He returned with one glass of wine and then forgot what I had ordered. After a while we asked to see a menu and decided to order the stuffed pepper appetizer. We were told they didn't have that.  

To make a long story short, we left with only having our two glasses of wine and no food. 

My suggestion is that you can go many places in downtown Pittsburgh and get treated very nicely and get good food... BUT NOT HERE!

Don't waste your time or money. They apparently don't want the business.",1.0

3rZB81LqTL2Aiq3mf5zxAw,"One of, if not the best, restaurant experiences we've ever had. My husband and I came to Scottsdale for our babymoon, we're expecting our first child. We walked into Olive & Ivy, no reservations, and were told that the wait inside was 2 hours but they could sit us in the patio. We took their offer and glad we did. Our server, Miranda, was attentive from the moment we sat down. She got our drinks right away. I asked if their feta was pasteurized & explained how there are certain cheeses I can't have since I'm pregnant. So we ordered the hummus for an app but no feta to be safe since she wasn't sure. Miranda still followed up with the kitchen to ask about their cheeses being pasteurized or not (which most are), and then we ordered the ""Natural Chicken"" and their ravioli. Radom servers would walk by to refill our waters when needed, food came out quick. My husband went and ordered a mojito, my favorite drink and I joked about how he's torturing me, but she offered a virgin mojito and took her up on it! My husband said it was the best mojito he's ever had and the virgin drink tasted almost identical. 
Toward the end of our meal, Miranda brought dessert menus and said, ""Dessert is on me, pick what you'd like!"" We were floored. We ordered the caramelized cake (AMAZING). At first we didn't understand why, and when the dessert came out, it said ""Congratulations!"" with a pink and blue candle. We so impressed with the food and service we asked for the manager, Jimmy. He was hospitable, respected by his employees by the way they interacted with him, and even had me try two of his favorite gelatos. 
Suffice to say our dinner experience was incredible. Both my husband and I were servers for a number of years, so for us to have great service from the hosts, bussers, and other servers, was pretty great.",5.0

We disagree with most on the value/flavor issue in that having too much pork weighs down the intricate flavors.

Around a year later, we returned for another dinner and this time it was underwhelming.  The food was OK, but when you're spending $200+ for two people you expect an exceptional experience.

Around a month ago, on the advice of a friend, I went for Sunday brunch.  It wasn't the first time I had heard about the great brunch there, so I was anticipating something special.

We arrived around 12:30 and ordered a couple of mimosas.  What they served us was orange juice with a splash of champagne.  We began with a selection of small plates.  I was most excited about the crabcake benedict, but I needn't have been.  Aside from being ridiculously small (it was truly more of an amuse bouche) -- the dish was bereft of flavor.  French toast was similarly disappointing.

So off to the buffet.  We should have checked its condition before we sat down.  It looked like a war zone.  Mid range hotel chains do a much better job of maintaining their buffets better than Upstream.  What was once a smoked salmon fillet was now a ravaged pile of flesh.  There were bits of food and trash around almost every station.  They were out of most of the premium items:  the salmon, crab legs and crab claws and sushi (which I probably wouldn't have eaten from a buffet anyway, but nevertheless...)  I ended up with an omelet -- it seemed safe, although expensive at $25.

iSJKHCx9FevXKaF3Hh52_w,"I've been here 4 or 5 times now so it only seems right that I get around to a review.

This bar sits right in the middle of bell road, a small hot spot for a lot of ""ehhhh okay I just wanna have a drink"" bars. That being said, this place is really enjoyable for what it is. They have quite a few regulars who are there every time I'm there. Last time I went there was a live band. I didn't care for them but the crowd seemed to really enjoy the cover band. I also managed to get a sweet happy hour(4 dollars on a jack and coke).

The staff disappears from time to time but for the most part they're pretty attentive. There are pool tables and darts, so there's always a little bit of this and a little bit of that if you don't wanna just sit around staring at a glass.

There's not a whole lot in the way of security here. The crowd is usually a healthy mixture of a younger and older crowd and the older crowd tends to get a bit overserved if you ask me. 

Long story short, this is a great place to just go have a couple of cheap drinks and have a conversation over a round of pool. The best part is they never close early like some bars do.",4.0
y53-AvyUwWCic-aNO3YrQw,"A Cantonese restaurant on the southwest side of town - what a treat! Rainbow Kitchen is a no-frills, non-trendy traditional Chinese restaurant. The staff was pleasant and helpful. I can see myself becoming a regular here.

Post-election day comfort food:
-Beef Pan-Fried Noodles
-Salted Fish, Chicken & Tofu Clay Pot
-Beef w/ Black Bean Sauce

I called in the order and picked it up 15 minutes later. Looks like deli items sell out fast - they ran out of crispy roast pork by 12:30PM. Everything was delicious and on par with Cantonese restaurants on Spring Mountain. The beef with black bean sauce is especially good - tender chunks of cubed beef stir fried with peppers & onions. I will definitely be back to try the ong choy, steamed fish, & sea bass clay pot.",5.0

I came again on a Sunday before watching a movie at Cineplex and thought their service was really fast. 

Our wings and appetizers came out within 15 minutes and we were done eating in 30 mins. Super satisfied with the timing because that left us with more than enough time to head to our movie.

t-w5qE-raErbxM3TzswlKw,"We stopped by Bonnie & Clyde's on Saturday night.  The place was packed at 7:30 and the wait for a table was over 1 hour.  We decided to come back on another night.  Sunday turned out to be not as busy.  

B & C's has almost gone over board on the ""gangsta"" theme.  Be sure to note the car and it's driver out front.  The menus have the appetizers listed as ""Petty Crimes"", salads are called ""The Big House"", pastas are ""Wise Guy"", seafood is ""Swimming with the Fishes"" and the shtick goes on.  As for the interior, some walls are red, some are a brushed metallic color.  Under the bar glows in green light.  We got a cozy booth complete with a plaque highlighting the career of ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd.  Servers are dressed in all black with deep red neck ties.  They are billing da joint was part restaurant/ part nightclub.  They have a huge bar and flat screen TV's scattered about and a DJ booth sits overlooking the dining room.  

For our meals, BJ got the ""Clyde Barrow"" bleu cheese sirloin.  The prime sirloin was smothered with melted bleu cheese and served with a baked potato and vegetable.  He really enjoyed his steak and so did I!  I opted for a single crab cake dinner.  It was served with poblano corn salsa and ""Bugsy"" secret sauce.  For my sides, I got the risotto and green beans.  For $2 extra, I got a salad and BJ got wedding soup.  We both thought our meals were very good.  His steak was perfectly cooked and had a lot of flavor.  His only complaint was temperature of a couple items.  His soup was luke warm and his potato wasn't very hot.  I thought my crab cake wasn't very fat, but still loved it, the seasoning, the sauce.  I am adding it to the list of my favorite crab cakes.  Not the best ever, but great in a different sort of way.  Plus, my meal was almost more than I could eat.  

BJ did make mention of his issues with his meal and our server sent a manager out right away.  Our server was really great.  We really like this new joint and look forward to coming back.",4.0

My friend and I went for lunch yesterday and we both had burgers. I had a bacon cheeseburger subbed with bleu cheese, my friend had an ostrich burger. I liked hers, l you could tell it is a leaner meat, but it was a little too birdy for me; I will stick to my moo burger.  I ordered my burger medium and it was done exactly so. Both were served on wheat buns. I also had the ""Famous"" tortilla soup which was very good with wonton chips on top, and also tried my dining partner's white chili which was made with chicken.

The service was very friendly and efficient even during the downtown lunch rush. The bathrooms are cute but tiny, and you enter through the kitchen.

Two store associates approached me to ask if there was something I was looking for.  When inquiring, one of them, a sweet gal happily directed me to a stand that sells various birthday treats (by Molly's Bakery of Canada).  Romeo (actually I) decided on the one cookie treat that would be perfect for him.   Romeo had a nice relaxing time being wheeled around in the shopping cart throughout the store and also enjoyed looking at the adorable kitties in the window (actually he was probably more likely wondering why he was in the store in the first place ;) ).  It was a special birthday for him as he's turned the big 1-0.  He enjoyed sampling the treat on the pedestal stand next to the red & green sparkling candles by our Christmas tree at home (he's a Christmas baby, after all ;) ).

My parents got asado and even though it was a little pink despite asking for it well done it was decent. The mollejas were good, the chimichurri was great, the bread seemed to be heated up in a microwave and was soft. The ricotta ravioles I got were hard and pretty bad, I couldn't even finish the plate. The masa of the empanadas were kinda doughy and unpleasant. The day I went there were three women working. One waitress was sweet, the other was... Just having a bad day I guess. 
I didn't get a refill on my drink til I was done eating, and I can understand that when you're busy you forget but come on, they checked on us twice throughout the whole meal. If you want something be sure to shout for it. 
Overall if you just want argentine cuisine for a decent price and aren't expecting a 4 star meal this is the place for you. I used to really love this place so I'm hoping they just had a bad day and will get back on track but as of right now I'm not planning to stop by next time I'm in town.",2.0
F7fCLHNX7XgFgU0xDlZpFg,"Never again. My daughter and I wanted to get a fun pedi before we left for a trip to Disney. We decided we would get matching Mickey Mouse heads on our big toes. I picked this place because I saw that they had chairs for kids, but my daughter wasn't even offered a seat in them. The spa pedis were decent and competitively priced for the area, but the paint job was absolutely atrocious. I should have known when they asked what design we wanted and I said Mickey Mouse heads and all we got in response were blank stares from the technicians. They really had no idea what we meant. So, I quickly did a search on my smart phone for an idea to show them. When I showed my technician right as she started my pedicure, she said, ""Ah, easy!"" So, I sat back and relaxed and figured all would be great. They asked if we wanted our fingers done, too and I declined because we were short on time. Am I glad I didn't pay for a manicure here! My daughter's nail tech said that she would include a paint job for my daughter at no extra charge since I was getting a longer pedicure. After seeing the awful job that was done on her nails, I am so glad that I only paid for a totally messed up pedi, not a messed up mani, too! The paint on her nails was incredibly sloppy. Her toes did turn out okay (not great,) so they were decent enough to go to Disney with, but my toes turned out HORRIBLY. The tech struggled to make a round circle to start off the head! The bottoms of both of the heads on my big toes was squared off! Plus, she was attempting to center the heads and one was way off to the left. Never mind the fact that the ears are proportionally way too small for the size of the rest of the head. It all looked awful! And then, to top all of that off, when she was painting them she accidentally dragged a line of black across the rest of my big toe and instead of fixing it properly, she just tried to just dab it with nail polish remover and then immediately paint over it. So underneath the 'mickey' head immediately began to chip! WORST PAINT JOB EVER! Finally, when I went to pay I was still going to leave a moderate tip, but when I handed the girl cash she acted shocked at the size of my tip and asked if it was for both techs or just one.

To start with, they are very friendly in a quiet sort of way. All you need to do is sit for a while and watch the steady stream of regulars on a Saturday or Sunday morning to know this café has a loyal following.

We were all about donuts on our most recent visit. They have all the flavors you could possibly desire, even bowing to recent trends like a maple long john with bacon. We passed on that choice, instead opting for a heavy dose of rainbow sprinkles. The raised donuts are light, soft and delicious.

Consider the Baker's Dozen, a best buy, if you are taking donuts to go. The fourteen count drops the price to about 70 cents a donut, a few cents less than the standard dozen.

The diversity of menu offerings will no doubt surprise you. They have an extensive menu of sandwiches, soups, salads, Panini, breakfast burritos, muffins, bagels...

They also have convenient group pricing for lunch and breakfast items, so you can bring more than just donuts to the office.

We ordered a nachos platter as an entrée, and we got the 4 chicken taco build-your-own (18$) and 3 hard shell tacos with rice (8$) First of all the nachos platter was very disappointing, almost no cheese, no salsa on the chips and barely any toppings. Plate came quite hot at least. Then maybe 40min later came our main course, my hard shell tacos were ok but my friend complained that his chicken was under-cooked and mediocre. This place is way overpriced for what you get and the service is very average.",2.0

I also had their dessert and the twist they put into the bahklava actually works, although I don't taste as much of the butter as in a tradition bahklava.

tcxNRU9lkc00g0ctqe7p_A,"If I had to describe this show in one word it would be ENERGY. 

Fortunately, I have enough space to leave a full review here! 

Jeff Civillico has the most energy of any entertainer I have known. He spends the full hour + show running, juggling, and even unicycling, around the stage while being hysterically funny. He is not afraid to take chances and adds new, innovative, tricks and ideas to his show (such as the go-pro camera, his giant blow-up set, a tv show he filmed searching for unique and talented entertainers, partnerships and promotions of fellow entertainers...).

It truly is a must see show... you never knew juggling could be this entertaining, until you've seen Jeff's show. I have seen his show at least 3 times and am always taking family and friends when they come to town. 

Aside from the show - Jeff has a great talent and an even bigger heart, giving back countless hours of entertainment and donations/fundraisers to several local charities on-stage and off. He also started Win-Win Entertainment to partner local charities with celebrities to help with their fundraising efforts. He is highly spoken about around town and I highly encourage you to support this great entertainer by seeing his show. I promise you won't be sorry.",5.0

My one complaint is that there isn't a lot of seating. Most of their seating is in the garage patio, which in the winter gets really cold. You also have to cut through the ice cream shop next door to get to it. From the outside, it looks like it is to-go only from the lack of tables.

75E1ZmIjzWgUNHyy26H6Vw,"Seems like the negative reviews I've read have to do with housekeeping.  I didn't experience that at all in my week long trip with my wife.  We had a room that had the washer and dryer, large bedroom, nice full kitchen, and spacious living room.  Everything was updated and beautiful, and we pretty much got to park a stones throw from our room.  It reminded me of having our own little apartment to vacation in!

While the hotel is well off the strip, but I found  this to be a huge bonus.  It made it easier to get places outside of the strip.  The place was quiet and peaceful.  They had a free shuttle that would take you to the strip and back, or we sometimes used Uber which was around 7 bucks each way.  I do have one bone to pick- my wife and I showed up for BINGO in the game room one day and nobody from the staff ever came to facilitate the game!  Bummer!

I am convinced that this is the only way people should vacation in Vegas!  Staying on the strip is expensive, busy and hectic.  This place allowed us to slow down and relax when we wanted to, and head down to the strip to party when we wanted to.  It was the best of both worlds!",5.0
auewboP1aENMq9v91UEwAw,"My sister and I decided to come here for lunch during the week, as she was craving sushi. I looked at the reviews and felt that the place would serve us decent food. First off, the location is somewhat difficult to find.. We drove around the plaza and could not see it. The parking lot is on the opposite side of the building, so the restaurant is facing hwy 7. 

Once we finally got there, it was half full so we were able to get a booth for ourselves. I really liked their menu, as it illustrates the majority of its menu items with pictures of the actual food. So when I was ordering my bento, I knew exactly what was coming. 

Our waitress was very accommodating and did her best to help us. My sister really dislikes salmon (I know, I don't understand it either...), so she asked the waitress to substitute her pieces of salmon sashimi for anything else. The waitress agreed and didn't charge us extra for the substitution. So, my sister has the sushi+sashimi bento and I had the chicken teriyaki combo and the sushi appetizer.

The bentos looked great and we were both hungry, so we dug in right away! Everything tasted great in my opinion, but one thing was a bit off. When my sister and I both tried the sushi, we were surprised to find that there was wasabi already added on the rice underneath the fish itself. Now, to me that was okay, but to someone like my sister who avoids spices it was not. We asked the waitress about this and she informed us that this was the traditional way to make sushi. I don't disagree, that may be true..however, we've never encountered this at any other location. She told us that we were supposed to inform her while ordering that we didn't want the wasabi. Only problem was that nowhere was it written on the menu that they do that. 

Regardless, she switched my sister's sushi and everything was fine. We both enjoyed our lunch and were full for a while. I would definitely come back again and maybe try some of their Korean items! So, the food was good and the service was great.",4.0
FRfv4KwKKHDt9yhlrUGCEQ,"The chorizo bahn mi was right at the top of our top 5! The bread was actually a shoe pastry (used for eclairs) that worked amazingly well.  We also tried their chocolate tamales and they were exceptional!!  We weren't going to wait in their line up for grilled cheese so I can't comment.

Pork Belly and their coffee both in my top 5. Pork sandwich could have included some crisp pork rind for that extra crunch but it was delicious and complete when compared to the other vendors. The coffee tasted great and amazingly smooth!

The Lemon Marscapone and the Salted Caramel Macarons were insane, out of the 6 or 8 flavours we tried. The big downside was how inconsistent the meringues were from flavour to flavour. The Vanilla Bean had a great taste but it was too hard to enjoy. I shared feedback to the vendor as she wanted to know my top choice, so I mentioned this inconsistency, and the woman told me all batches come out different. She would give my feedback to Katrina who makes them. I was then disappointed about the known inconsistency but more so with the fact that Katrina wasn't even at the event!

La Carnita was lined up and I have already eaten them twice in the past so we skipped that line. I am sure they would have been in my top 5 but they are certainly far from novice!

1. Bahn Mi
2. Chocolate Tamale
3. Pork Belly
4. Coffee
5. Macaron
(6. Rillette / Sauerkraut - it was just not my thing but it was well done!)

Beyond those top treats, there were terrible items not worth mentioning and there were some near-hits. Some foods I suspect were great at home but weren't exectuted properly given the limitations of the environment. 

My near-hits...
Had the scotch egg been served room temperature instead of cold, more flavours would have come through and it possibly would have rated in my top 5 bumping the macaron.  The seasoned potato chips could have rated had they not been so inconsistent from chip to chip - some had seasoning while some lacked and others were just plain soggy rather than crisped. The Popovers were a great idea, poorly executed. We bought 3 figuring that each would be so unique but instead we found that the base was the same for all with a bit of bacon or feta sprinkled on top. As well, they were not warmed all the way through. I am not sure there is a way to serve awesome popovers, except right out of the oven!!  And the flavours should have been incorporated throughout the dough!

Unless I forgot something, there was nothing else worth mentioning out of our samplings. We tried maybe 7 or 8 additional items.",4.0

kmconjoRcZIPfwPdVW4dfg,"This place was recommended to me by long-time Vegas locals, but I was very disappointed. I can only conclude that it's under different management, etc. The guys behind the counter were NOT helpful, and did not seem at all interested in diagnosing my range's problem. They just wanted to look up part numbers and quote outrageous prices. They just gave me some standard line about calling the manufacturer and paying $240 for a replacement part.  Turns out that part WAS NOT the problem, and I fixed the issue myself (for free) by cleaning out a valve unit (which I physically brought in to the store, and they failed to help with at all).

I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 just because they're really the only big parts warehouse in town, with a retail counter, that I'm aware of. So, if they stock a part and you need it immediately, fine. If you want some actual help and customer service, go somewhere else.",2.0

The place is usually well-cleaned, and I've been fortunate to go when not too crowed, so don't have to wait long for my pizza. My husband and I like the thin crust of their pizzas. While there are diverse toppings, we stick to our favorites of marinara sauce, mozzarella, carmalized onions, black olives, green bell pepper, pepperoni and the non-spicy sausage.

Update 5 minutes after leaving this review:
So, the owner (Vanessa) called me and we spoke about this situation.  She advised me if there was a cancellation tomorrow she could get us in or Tuesday for sure.  She also called my mother and told her she would call her next week as well.

Vanessa was nice, explaining she is a mother of 4 and last time they ran this add they had the same problem.  She said they had over 300 groupon purchases.  So, knowing this is a reoccurring problem as an owner I would state that in the Groupon advertisement.   

She did call me after hours to try and speak to me the first time but I couldn't understand her due to the spotty cell coverage as she was driving.  So, if I misunderstood her my apologies.   

I am still trying to get a refund through Groupon as I wanted to get something done for my mother tomorrow.  We will see what happens.

68O1085GyuMg8AAjYagsbg,"Buyer Beware!  Our experience with this company began in January, 2012 and has continued to deteriorate over time.  Our air conditioner went out because of an electrical panel short.  We referred to the ""To Fix It"" list and identified an electrical company to come out.  They did a great job in fixing our electrical issues but could only recommend another company to handle the air conditioning issue.  It was a weekend and freezing cold and since we were so pleased with the service we received from the electrical company we believed what they said about One Hour AC&H.  They recommended a new unit, said our ducts needed to be completely redone because they were so old and deteriorating, vents need to be installed, that if we purchased this new unit our heating and cooling costs would be reduced by 50%.  That's what he said -- by 50%.  (BTW - our electric bill has not gone down one cent since installing the new unit.)  Over the course of 2 days they completely redid everything -- installation, all new ductwork and vents, a cleaning system.  The works.  Since then half of the our house is still warm; we've had service people out several times and they don't even know why they've been told to come to our house.  At one point we discovered that our filtration system had not even been hooked up.  Our son was asked to crawl up into the attic to help them complete the installation.  The vent holes were sloppily cut and some of vents don't cover the damage done to the drywall.  They installed a vent in our garage storage room!!!!!  We paid for the bi-annual servicing of the unit and every time we make an appointment they call and say that they've got so much to do they can't make it out to our house.  They did that to us 3 times and at that point we told them if they didn't show up the fourth time we wanted our money back for the service plan.  A service guy did show up this past weekend and wanted to know why we had several of our vents closed - we had done that to help with the lack of cooling on the one side of the house.  The service guy said it wasn't good to do that because it put pressure on the fan.  He then went up into the attic and came back down and said that there was a 2 inch gap in the ductwork which he said he fixed and that should help with the temperature.  He also said he would talk to his supervisors about this and that someone would be calling us.  We've tried talking to these folks many times and they never call back.  We to date have not received a call back as the last service guy promised.  Don't EVER use this company.  We found out later that they work on commission.  They are only interested in selling expensive units and have no intention of following up on their promises.  I'm embarrassed to let any of you know how much we paid (are still paying) for this experience. As part of the sales pitch we were also told that our new unit would be eligible for an energy-savings rebate from the electric company.  After we purchased the unit, and after we had to remind them of the rebate offer several weeks later, they submitted the rebate request, which was ultimately denied.",1.0

I would have lunch, then sit there all afternoon refilling my drink cup and saying ""HIt me again"" to the girl who came around with the basket of breadsticks every  fifteen minutes.  By the time I was done with my studying, I would be so full of breadsticks that I didn't need dinner.  Fazoli's helped me through college and grad school.  

Since those days (many years ago, sadly), they've gone downhill faster than a Red Zephyr wagon with two fat kids in it.  They tinker needlessly with the menu.  Their food has gotten tasteless. And for a time, you had to go ask for the breadsticks instead of having them brought to you.

I showed her the pic of the original cut and just asked for it to be cleaned up. I don't know where it went wrong, she asked me about the razor length (I'm a female I have no idea what the means and the last stylist did not tell me what it was) since I didn't know she went with the shortest one possible, since the other one ""didn't make much of a difference"". As she made the first buzz cut on his hair I said oh jeez that is really short. Her words ""well, guess you will know for next time "" and proceeded to buzz my kids hair down to military length! The only part I asked her to shorten was the front and I'm pretty sure she didn't even touch that. Now I get it I am new to the way barber shops works but I had no idea that one shop can have such good stylists that make my kid look amazing and then another that even with a picture of the cut makes him looks Like he just finished basic training for the military! I'm horrified and embarrassed with his hair and other then totally shaving his head have really no choice but to live with it and with the looks that people give me for the WTF did you do to your kids hair! 

I'm giving this shop a decent review based on the first cut and the decent way they deal with little kids but I will be sure to watch out for some of the stylists in training they must have there or maybe she really didn't care because he was a little kid so what does it matter.

It too a while to come out and they wee served on disposable plates and plastic ware. Not a huge deal, but I guess I had higher expectations from a place called waffles cafe. So, not horrible, just not sure if ilk be running back for more anytime. If you've had and enjoy blueberry hill waffles you will more than likely be dissatisfied.

The wait was not long, and the sandwich was pretty ok. I just wish that it had just a little bit more flavor to it. But all in all, pretty decent. The service was very pleasant, and so I will return to try out another item.

Get. The. Meatball. Cone. 

You're welcome. 

Seriously, if you're like me and love carbs on carbs on carbs. This is the place for you. The menu is simple, salads and soups, BYO pastas, bread cones and paninis. 

I ordered the Roman Holiday salad and it was delicious! I loved the marinated mozzarella balls. And the balsamic mustard dressing was divine. Totally the way to go if you want a heart salad to start your meal. I ordered the small and it's a great portion so it could definitely be a meal on its own. 

Now, on to that meatball cone. It's a yummy bread cone stuffed with penne pasta, sauce, veggies, meatballs and cheese. You have the option to skip the veggies and I did just that...gimme the carbs. 

The meatballs were delicious! Great flavors and I loved the sauce. And they were not skimpy with the serving size! So good. If your debating what to order...this is the way to go.

My in-laws reserved a private room which was so nice and spacious. It had a fireplace which made it feel cozy on a chilly fall November evening. There were a few kids in the group so it was nice to have our own room so as not to bother other patrons. I highly recommend keeping this in mind if you're planning a small gathering either personally or professionally. I would like to particularly thank Anthony, Clarence and Skylar (hopefully I got the spelling right) who waited on our party and did a fabulous job. They were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and patient with our group and happy to help make suggestions/recommendations on food and drink orders. There were several toasts made throughout the evening and they were always cognizant to close the double doors and to stop service while speeches were being made. My husband ordered a Filet Mignon and a side of Sautéed Asparagus, I ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll, both meals were delicious. Our entire group enjoyed the meals and merriment.

    The second pizza from Ephesus that I ordered about two weeks ago I ordered by phone and when I requested the lite cheese extra sauce the person taking my order seemed disinterested and made me feel rushed to get off the phone. When I picked up the pizza it was the exact opposite that I wanted it. It definitely had extra cheese and very little sauce.
   So today I decided to give them one more chance, I figured if I ordered online, at least my special request of lite cheese, extra sauce would be ""written"" down.
    So I am sure you all know where this is going!,I picked up the pizza, took it home, and there it was, extra cheese and hardly any sauce at all. My friend with whom I was sharing the pizza described it as ""cheesy bread"" and nothing more. We were in the mood for very good pizza and all we got was ""cheesy bread'.

I actually had something to return. I had purchased Angels On Bare Skin (a face wash) and it turns out I'm allergic to the lavender in it. Janea was super helpful. I explained to her what happened and that I just wanted to exchange it. She also helped me pick a new face wash. Janea even did a little demonstration on my hands using the face wash and a couple other products. Plus, she helped me find the perfect face moisturizer. It was great that she gave me a sample of the moisturizer to try at home. 

Because it was the grand opening they had fruit kabobs and fruit juices. It was super cute that each juice was named after a Lush product.

This Lush is just like every Lush I've gone to as far as customer service. It's beyond amazing! Everyone is so friendly and are very helpful. You can tell they really love the product they sell.

Now that we have been here 4 or 5 times, I am happy to say that every time they get better.  Yes, the food was *yawn* in the beginning and the service was a bit...scattered, but they have come along nicely.  We still like Azteca's food much better, but for walking distance in Mint Hill, it's not bad.  The margaritas are excellent (which is another reason to walk), reasonably priced and frequently on special..in fact....they have drink specials most nights.The guacamole is fresh, but pretty boring.  (Perhaps once you have Azteca's guacamole made before your eyes at your table, you are ruined for life?).   You can order ""half orders"" of a lot of their appetizers, (the hot queso is excellent) which is a nice touch.

My favorite entree so far is the enchiladas with the mole sauce. Three Enchiladas, your choice....chicken, beef or cheese, topped with mole sauce and melted cheese. Served with rice and beans.  The rice is good..the beans...meh.  The partner likes the Chile Verde, big tender pieces of pork in what I understand to be some really good verde sauce. Service has gotten much better (much more friendly and efficient), chips are warm and fresh, salsa is ok.  HINT:  If you like spicy (as we do) ask your server for the ""Hot Salsa"" they keep hiding in the back (my guess is habanero), mix it with the house salsa and you are good to go!

0BmB0dU-o6_ICFIj14LdUg,"I was informed the other day by a friend at the U of C that MacKimmie LIbrary Tower is now completely closed, due to the opening of the Harvey Digital Library. Since I've finished my degree I haven't been on campus a lot to clarify, but I don't know if I have the heart to go in and see for myself anyways. 

There has always been something about this library, that could never be replicated by the University's new library building which resembles the Facebook headquarters and was a terrible mess to figure out (I worked temporarily in the library during the HDL's development. I find this new library kinda soulsucking, Everyone who likes this new library has no soul, or is obviously a business major or something. No offense).  

Something about MacKimmie used to inspire me to totally kick it old school. I would sit down for hours at a time 

 Each winter at school, I lived for the days where I would get myself a giant cup of tea, head of to the 10th library tower, and hide out for hours at a time. Ofttimes, I would go laptop free, surround myself with all the relevant reading materials I needed, and draw up a first draw from scratch. I took so much enjoyment in doing this. I always kind of wonder how most students in university would fare without the convenience of the internet and having so much information at our fingertips. Really, anyone can graduate with a degree if they know how to use wikipedia. It's a bummer. 

One time though, when trying to write a twelve page paper on Ernesto Guevara, I gathered a bunch of books which were mostly in Spanish, hoping that if I thought about it hard enough, these words would just fall off the page into English translations for me. This was not the case and eventually I did have to enlist the help of the internet for translation purposes.  But, MacKimmie is so magical, THAT IT MADE ME THINK I COULD JUST LEARN SPANISH BY STARING AT IT. 

MacKimmie would also remind me of the fragile and beautiful tangibility of books. It was in this very library that I fell in love with a first pressing of Kerouac's ""Big Sur,"" worn and weathered and dying to be checked out and rescued. While working in the library for awhile if I had nothing to do, I would often escape to the 10th floor and spend a few hours reading through Bukowski poetry. This was always such a treat. 

MacKimmie, if the rumours were true, I will miss you very much. You were not outdated. You were a REAL LIBRARY, and irreplaceable to me. Rest in peace.

Ss6J-eENwWdP3UPfC1sjLA,"Ever done hard time?  This (former Dairy Queen?) has so many bars on the windows you may feel like you're in (or have a flashback to when you were in) the mess hall at San Quentin (Sheriff Joe Would stick you in a tent city).

Actually - the interior is very clean, the tables and chairs are new, the service provided is very nice - plus (bonus) after lunch you are not limited to 30 minutes of rec time per day in the yard.

The food is damn good.  Small portions for small prices.  Order at the counter and then take a seat in the dining area.  We tried the picadillo and rajas gorditas as well as the standard beef and chicken tacos.  Authentic.  Tasty.  But not mind-blowing...

The condiment bar es muy bueno.  The chunky salsa verde is the shining star, and their runny guacamole sauce is similar to that at El Guero Canelo.  But I thought the red sauce tasted too much of the same flavor as a can of El Pato sauce, and they slice the fresh radishes waaay too thin (like thinner than potato chip thin).  And what's up with served ice cold charred serranos?  If you want 5 stars from me those roasted peppers should be roasted daily and served warm!

This is a fine 4 star addition to the local area and, like most parolees from the big house, we will be back!!",4.0

While we  waited they brought out some warm biscuits with butter and honey on the side which I put together for my toddler to munch on while we waited.

q0ks6BpT1Swsq7kad_QzAQ,"I've been meaning to write this review for quite sometime but it slipped my mind. I started at RCR in 2013 after being introduced to the gym through a friend who coached at the gym at the time Ben. Immediately I felt welcomed by the coaching staff who spent much more time with me then they had to. I remember one instance within my first two months where coaches and owners Ken and Bryan spent over an hour after class working with me on my snatch, I must have gone through over 100 reps in that hour and I learned so much about positioning and speed. Coach Dylan did the same thing for me with muscle ups the following month and eventually I got one. It's hard to remember all the times that coaches spent extra time with me after or before class(and we would be here all day if I told you), but I can tell you that had to be hundreds during my nearly 3 years at Ramsay. 

The Classes at Ramsay are a hour long each but often you'll find people show up quite early to stretch and socialize with other members.  The format generally consists of a warm up then a strength or skill portion followed by a Metcon. The strength portion and metcons are almost always programmed as a part of a bigger picture with a focus on certain skills whether it be Olympic lifting, Gymnastics, Conditioning or any combination of those and I saw very consistent and steady improvements during my time at Ramsay. 

If your looking to get into Olympic weightlifting RCR also has a barbell club which is fantastic. I spent the majority of my last year with RCR working on Olympic lifting with coach Geoff. He also led me through my first weightlifting competition which was a blast. The barbell club has to be one of the funnest group I've ever had the pleasure to train with and I've made some great friends through the club. 

If I had one final thing to say about RCR I would say that most people walk through the doors hoping to get fit but the reason most people stick around is because of the community, I made a lot of great friends during my time at RCR and had some great experience as a result of my time there.",5.0

Things I liked:
It's only about 10 minutes from where I'm staying. 
The trailhead has water for people & dogs, great parking, & is easy to get to on paved roads.
The trail itself is easy to follow, well marked, and a reasonable distance, about 4 miles round trip to the top.
The views are great, even during the middle of the day.
I went during the week, and there were lots of hikers, but not an overwhelming amount.

Things I disliked:
Not much really, but I have to say, the trail can be treacherous. It is very rocky with lots of slippery gravel. Be careful. Consider using a walking stick or sticks, mostly to help you on the way down.

Quite the combination and they made my taste buds cry out in joy.  The plain shrimp balls and thin noodles were nicely done.  Very nicely - the plate was heaping, and we were each able to get 4 portions out of it.  We also tried the pork and vegetable balls which were heavenly.  I can't forget about the shrimp balls coated with roe - it was as if the sea had walked off the plate into my mouth.

The restaurant is not set up well for a smooth-flowing buffet line.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the direction the line should move, and I grew frustrated with the people who could not even make it through a buffet line without stopping to text.

""Large"" pitchers of sangria run $20 and are heavy on fruit, but light on wine.  Baskets of bread are $3.50 each, and the create-your-own antipasto had larger servings of ""accessories"" than meats or cheeses.

Thank you for winning my worst lifetime customer experience besides Sears and CapitalOne. They harassed me at least 5 times on a yearly basis to rentals I had, and trying deeply hard to take money from your pocket for fault not made by myself but other Zipsters / strangers. If you eventually find sufficient proof to show them you are innocent and upset, then they gave you a verbal sorry and that is it, easy than anything. And expect harassments and taking more and more money from your credit card account without giving you sufficent proof. You want to fight for it? It took days, your patience, and your mood as well.

Overall their nonprofessional practices and sneaky customer experience have outweighed the convenience they provided. To me they are more like a scam or a drug now, it does me more financial harm in long term. I am planning to report them to BBB currently.

My friends, I can write tons of my sad AND  true stories honored by Zipcar but I decided just not to use it in my life(Even their cancellation takes time, haha.).

Brushed it off, and ordered the ""number"" on the menu.  The immediate response was an eye roll and ""what is that number?""  After responding I was given a ""oOOOooh that one, a Winner's Burger.""  The tone had a bit of snark in it as if I was expected to just order the name after the number that was sitting in front of it that was showing on the menu board.

After paying, I stood back and watched to see if it was just me receiving treatment or if it was everyone.  Everyone got it, until a friend who worked at another establishment came.  Demeanor became very casual, smiles and laughs, and talking of ""whatchu gonna do after work guuurl?!?!"" all while taking the order of another customer was the hot topic of conversation.  Reading the facial expression and body language of this customer was obvious she was bothered by it, but she did not want to say anything.

I waited a solid 20 minutes for my order of a burger and fries, and half of that time, the fries say there on the counter with lid open getting cold.  Burger came out but was not cooked to order.  Based on timing I could not afford to go back as I had to get to my plane.  Burger was ordered medium well but came back well done x3 and nearly had a crispy texture to it.  My fries had been solid and cold upon arrival which was bothersome as it could have been closed while I waited and not left open.

Altogether, I feel a sit down experience may be better, but these three employees working the carry out side seem to be very disconnected with customer service and only there to have fun with each other.  No urgency with service, no common sense to food service standards.  Disappointing to say the least.  If you go, give yourself time to enjoy a sit down experience.",1.0

Value: Food is  very good value.  We got a free creme brulee with purchase of two mains. Drinks were a little over priced..  particular the beer and cocktails.

The food: But the pork belly was divine.  The shrimp croquettes was something we would not get again.... but that pork belly was another story- super crisp skin and tender buttery flavourful meat.

MsWoMcoXgXKrfc0pwjEUMw,"One Saturday I sat at the bar for lunch. There was no wait to sit there (or in the dining room for that matter) and as soon as we sat down the bartender approached and welcomed us. 

We ordered our food and afterwards the bartender specifically asked us if we wanted bread. We said yes...but bread never came. 

We ordered the appetizer Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos and chose the Asian style. The lettuce leaves were large enough to hold all the fillings successfully. They were filled with grilled chicken and then you could pick one of two types of flavors. We chose Asian which included carrots, bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro and rice noodles. One spicy cashew and one sweet cilantro sauce came with it. These were good. 

For my main I ordered the lunch portion of the Shepherd's Pie. I'm not opposed to non traditional SPs, I love them in fact, but this one wasn't good. Mashed potatoes were placed on top, but not covering the entire top and not baked on. Peas, carrots, zucchini and onions were mixed in the mushroom gravy below the potatoes. The mushroom gravy flavor was noticeable. This was all good. 

The meat however, was not ground beef as the menu description simply indicated. The meat was a broken apart flame-grilled hamburger. I could clearly taste the flame grilled aspect of the meat. The meat was also not in crumbles, but was in chunks as if literally a hamburger had been grilled and ripped apart. Between the flavor and the texture of the meat the dish was ruined.",2.0

Y6SXKVyrn2VV9xSCVpmFbA,"I was starving and sick from a bad sinus infection... My cravings were something fried, but also wanted some spicy soup to balance the two out. My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong!!! 

We walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!

I enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!

My minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. 

Their side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.

This restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.

The location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!! Good service, great meal, and satisfies my cravings for Korean-Chinese cuisine.",4.0

B_1HqrwINKkIEnekkxtpsA,"Sigh. This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.

Let's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.

I ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi/sashimi/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi/sashimi/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.

Everything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi/sashimi/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.

What probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.

xok9d9hL9sKQd9cQYR5UMQ,"I first visited Something White four years ago when my sister was a bride. We drove down to Hudson, Ohio from Michigan to visit a boutique that had the dress she was looking for. When we arrived, they told us the dress wasn't there (despite having called just a couple hours before and they said they were holding it). My poor sister was devastated, and understandably stressed and unhappy. We did a quick Google search for other boutiques in the area, and Something White came up. The designer she wanted was in their shop, however, we noticed it was closing in 20 minutes and we were about a 15 minute drive away.

So my sister called them, explained the situation, and without any hesitation they said they would stay open so she could try dresses on. WOW. We were already impressed with them!

Once we got there, we immediately felt comfortable. It has a homey feel thanks to the decor and the owners. They make it such a personal and wonderful experience. Thanks to them, my sister was able to find her dream dress!

Cut to four years later, and it was my turn! We knew we wanted to go back to Something White thanks to the experience we had with my sister. It was so exciting and surreal to be the bride this time, and their dress selection was a dream. I tried on about 7 dresses, and they were very respectful of my budget while helping me pick out the dresses. They made this experience so stress free, comfortable, and FUN! 

When it was my sister's turn, my mom and sister celebrated with champagne while I sipped on sparkling grapejuice (I wasn't 21 yet!). It was a very exciting moment this past June when we ALL got to drink the champagne. :)

D--5KHl1zwg3bRID_JYvtA,"**UPDATE**

Wow! Worth the wait! My eyelashes are amazing! They look completely natural and my eyes look huge. 

I really enjoyed my visit with Sarah. She explained the entire process and gave clear instructions for after care. She is very personal and you can tell (and she'll tell you) she loves what she does. 

So happy with my visit. More eyelash technicians are starting soon and I'm sure they will give the same quality of care as Sarah does. 



I will have to update this review if I ever have my eyelashes done here. At this time, however, I am extremely frustrated with the scheduling and customer service. 

I purchased a Groupon in August to get my eyelashes done. There were no appointments available until the end of September. I scheduled an appointment for Sept 28. 

On September 28, as I was driving to the appointment, ten minutes before my appointment, they called me and said there has been an emergency and they would have to reschedule my appointment. I said no problem, the girl on the phone said she'd call me back and reschedule tomorrow. So Tuesday comes and goes and Wednesday I call back to see when we can reschedule. The girl on the phone recognized me and had said she was sorry for not calling me back she didn't know which ""Amy"" I was. We reschedule for Sunday - even though they aren't open Sunday. 

So today I drive out there and call to find the place because it's kinda hidden and the girl who answered was rather short with me and said I didn't have an appointment and I had to reschedule AGAIN for Wednesday. 

Long story short, if a company is going to charge a $75 same day cancellation policy I think they owe me $150 for cancelling on me twice.",5.0

The reason why I am giving this store 2 stars is that of the fact that the person that was helping us with the ski helmets were nice and brisk. He gave advice and was friendly at all times. Then I went with my family to purchase a north face jacket. It was originally around $540 but it was 25% off so it was $410. We wanted to see if we could get a better deal so we talked to the manager. He said no which I could understand but we still attempted to bargain. However what was not okay was his attitude towards us was really inpatient and unmerciful. He said that north face was really lucky to get them some deal for boxing day that was 25% off. I don't find this kind of attitude okay towards any kind of customer. I also realized that the people that worked there they got a commission. Basically, the woman that first helped us placed her commission id on the price tag. The second lady that helped us was outrageous. Saying that there is actually 50% off and then placed HER commission tag over the other lady's id. After that, she just left us not doing anything. When we got the cashier there was a fight over the price between the cashier and us and multiple managers came over. The one that we spoke to (he was bald I don't know his name) was in a very uncalming attitude saying that he already spoke to us and we are wrong and didn't listen when the other lady that placed her commission tag over said it was $300. So I don't understand who is hiring these people. The person that worked at the cashier used absolutely no manners but pounding in the fact that our price ($300) is wrong at our faces. My whole family was really upset and we just bought the ski helmet and left. I have always been sympathetic to businesses that give poor service but this was absolutely outrageous. Later on in the day we went to Vaughan Mills shopping mall and went directly to the North Face shop there. We got the same jacket for $300. Yea sure my *** that 25% off was good. Everything in that store was overpriced the service was terrible. It was my mother's birthday so you imagine the anger.",2.0

x6wDAWfLj55SwKyLxdswOw,"Was in Vegas this weekend with friends for a birthday celebration and we decided Sunday to have lunch at Wolfgang Pucks restaurant at MGM. I'd never eaten at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant so I was excited to try it out.  Sad to say I'll probably never eat at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant again.  We all enjoyed our food, but the service was HORRIBLE. 

It started with our waiter basically throwing the drink menu on the table. When he came back, the first thing he said was ""do you have any questions?""  How about your name?  Luckily we were ready to order so he took it and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It took almost an hour from when we sat down till we received our food.  The tables around us all got their food before us, even tables that sat down after us.  One table sat down after us, ordered, ate AND paid before we got our food.  At one point the waiter came by and my friend asked him where our food was and he said it would be right out.  I was getting ready to go find the manager to ask about our food when the manager came to us.  He said our food was being plated as he spoke, but it still took another 5 minutes for it to arrive.  

After the manager talked to us, our waiter barely came by our table; he wouldn't even make eye contact when he walked by.  He did manage to clear my drink glass, but didn't bother to ask me if I wanted another one.  After the wait we'd had, I would have taken a second drink, but I guess he didn't want us to linger.  

It was also disappointing that the manager didn't bother to compensate us for the long wait and crappy service.  We're not sure why the manager came to us, but clearly he knew something was wrong. How about trying to make it right?  If he had, I probably wouldn't be writing this review.",1.0

xC-A44WUk4-oepxbU1-xSA,"The food is just OK. 

The menu being long without a focus was my first sign that the food would be mediocre. So I kept it simple and order the burger with bacon and the dry rub chicken wings. 

The burger was decent but for 9$ and some change, I wish I had a Five Guys burger or something of that caliber. The chicken wings were super dry like tough meat dry. I am positive the wings had been under the hot lamp for hours before I ordered them. I first thought that the meat had been dried out from being fried too long but the food arrived too quickly and was not hot enough for this to be the case.

This was my first time ordering from ClusterTruck. The only reason why I did was that I had a $10 off of $15 coupon. Plus I wanted to take advantage of the curbside service. But honestly, the burger and wings were not worth the $12 I spent after using the coupon.

ptKXXJEqv7y-c-x1fJtKzA,"I've debated leaving this review for a good while. I've been here many times and I keep giving it another chance because I love the idea of the place but unfortunately the service is still awful. If you decide to eat here you need to plan on staying 2-3 hours due to extremely slow service (even if you make a reservation on their special nights). It's always taken at least 20-30 minutes after being seated just to get waters, let alone orders taken. Some of the food is amazing, some is mediocre. Usually it comes out room temperature which is another bummer. The place is small, 11-12 tables maybe, usually with 2-4 people at a table. Last time we were there, we saw 3 different people waiting the tables but were also checking people out. Perhaps it would be easier for them if they had someone run the register and to-go area and other people work the tables. It really is too small to have these sorts of issues. Another problem is that we usually each order something from the first, seconds, and thirds on the menu but they ALL come out at the same time. Don't expect appetizers here. We also ordered iced coffees which were dropped off quickly without a word, and creamers were not offered until the next refill. And the cherry on top, is my poor 6 year old child almost always gets served his food last- which is just pancakes and fruit (the only thing on the ""kids menu""). Why it takes over an hour for that, I just don't understand. If you still want to eat here, get food off the to-go menu- unless you like spending a good portion of your day in very hot, non- air conditioned restaurants.",2.0

So you can imagine, I'm afraid to buy plants and spend good money on them because I'm just gonna kill em all.

My husband and I made our way to the nursery section and started off on the left side where all the cacti were placed. We were thinking of something low maintenance as we had the Summer season also in mind and wanting plants that could handle the hellish Vegas summer.

As my husband got quickly bored of looking at cacti, we started to make our way over to the pretty flowers, when Mary showed up. She's so wonderful! We learned a lot from her as my husband pretty much held Mary's attention for over 5-minutes. As you can see, Mary is very patient with novices.

With Mary's help and another patron's help, who happened to cut me off to scoop up two sets of the flowers I was looking at, we picked up 8 little pots of flowers full of buds, as the other patron advised us to.  

Two weeks later, the flowers, wish I knew what we bought, are blooming nicely. They're so pretty. I go out in my backyard everyday after work just to see how they are doing and enjoy its beauty.

This place is busy... real busy.... and for good reason!

Their website vaguely boasts a variety of 250 choices to choose from and when you'll get around to the menu.... you can see why! They have something for everyone and you can mix it up to get what YOU want.

I went with the ""Le Petinos"" a huge breakfast plate with a variety of meats and eggs. I won't necessarily break it down how everything tasted but overall it was simply exceptional with no disappointments. I particularly loved their home-style potatoes that were simply out of this world good. The other patrons at my table all enjoyed their meals with very well presented grub even though they had a lot of clients at the door. They truly ensure to make sure you don't feel rushed when you're dining there. Did I mention to potatoes? Yeahhhhhh.... but everything else was on spot too... but them taters..... *drool*

The service was really good as well despite how busy it was. It was attentive with plenty of coffee refills. We were probably their more difficult table with 3 toddlers but we were well taken care of while we took care of our toddlers to not bother the other patrons. :) The food arrived in a timely fashion along with every needed check-up. It was impressive.

When I checked in at The Venetian on Aug 19, their computer system was down and they were taking everyone's credit card numbers by hand, writing them down, having you write your phone number and full name and signing.  I was very nervous about this, so I used my American Express card.

I had a great time at the hotel, but when I got home, I was alerted by Amex by multiple fraudulent internet charges.  I contacted one of the merchants and it turns out the customer had used my correct full name, credit card number, and phone number but the wrong billing address.  Interesting that they had the info I wrote down for The Venetian but nothing else.  

Amex took care of the fraud immediately, but when I called The Venetian, they didn't care at all.  They said that there was no investigation and that I couldn't prove it was someone from their hotel.

There are no words to even describe the water play area, with raincoats included. Remember playing in the sink when you were younger? Well this is like the water-parks of sinks with toys, spouts and all sorts of indoor, splashy things to keep your chillins busy. (And right at their level too!)

Some special notes include: the entire make-believe village with a supermarket, bank, hospital, airport gate, bus, house, and more. If I had a store that realistic to play in when I was little, I would have died and gone to heaven. Also, spend the extra $1 or 2 on the special events they have (i.e. the arts stuff, mummy thing, etc.) It's cheap and totally worth it.  Last but not least, they've filled an entire room with sand and decorated it like Egypt. Go.Play.Here.Now. 

Germ-o-phob? These people take special care to provide wipes, hand sanitizer stations and bins for dirty toys. You know, like if your toddler sticks something in the mouth area, you can just drop it into the labeled bins. Love the attention to detail!

On last thing: feed your kids before you take them here. Although they have some snacks (healthy and not-so-healthy) and drinks available, I wish they would provide a cafeteria area to have lunch.

Before we went, we both felt apprehensive as we assumed that we'd stand out by virtue of being a duo of female customers in a maid cafe. And we were right since when we arrived, we counted a total of four female customers, including ourselves, against the backdrop of maybe a dozen male customers. This made the two of us, who are timid to begin with, quite nervous; however, this feeling of nervousness disappeared with the emergence of our waitress/maid. Even as a females, we had to admit that our tiny, round-eyed, cat earred waitress/maid was cute! Not only that, she was also super nice! When our themed cakes came out, she got us to sing a little jingle to promote the deliciousness of the cakes which both embarrassed and amused us. Something that we only saw happening in manga and anime was happening to us in real life, it was kind of surreal!

-fDdr16YT8AYubdqG1g3ZQ,"After numerous failed attempts of trying to find a decent therapist in this town, I gave up. Years later, I got married and my husband knew of a place that a close friend of his works at, Harmony HealthCare. 
I reluctantly went ahead and made an appointment with them. I was pleasantly suprised by how super sweet the call center lady was with me, while making my appointment. She was able to get me an appointment with a therapist, only 2 days away. I was very impressed at this point, with the quality of customer service and care I had received by just the I initial appt making experience alone. But when I went into there office for my appointment, I was so impressed with how clean, comfortable and overall feeling I had with the office itself as well as with the reception desk ladies. 
Most of all, I was overjoyed to find that my therapist was a one of a kind!! Genuinely caring and highly qualified therapist with all the energy and devotion she puts in with every single session I've had with her. She doesn't spend time writing in a notebook as I'm talking. She is always making eye contact, with the warmest and caring expression on her face. I truly believe that she cares greatly about helping me with my anxieties and so on. 
I truly am not exaggerating about how wonderful this therapist is. After every session with her, I feel like a whole new me. So you can imagine that after only 4 sessions with her & each session helps me feel like a whole new person,  then I've had 4 life positive changing experiences, all due to the greatest woman/therapist I've ever had the pleasure of finding in my life!! 
Sylvia, at Harmony HealthCare at the Post Rd, LV, NV location is truly the greatest hope (I believe) for those who suffer with many types anxiety disorders, as I do. I recommend to all that are seeking a life altering change, to see Sylvia. 
I know that I've rambled on quite a bit, but I just wanted to make it as clear as I could because I too gave up hope of finding the right therapist and then I found her. If she can do for you, what she's done for me, why not give her a try?",5.0

SRCSI2rwSgGiLYYHAiJIuQ,"So happy we opted for this hotel in Pitts. As newcomers to visit DT Pitts for a wknd we found ourselves with minimal options to book affordably downtown in our very last minute search to book. So, we booked in DblTree Green- best choice!
The front desk welcome experience was great! The room was comfy & clean. I did not experience the ""endless walk/dungeon feel"" other reviewers have posted. Yes, it is a large hotel but , seriously, NOT that big.... Anyhow, we didn't feel the walk to our room was any different than that in any other of the hundreds of hotels we've stayed at.
The lobby is quite nice and they have good options for lobby dining/bar and full starbucks on-site which is rare and awesome!
Parking was plenty.

Best of All - it is considerably cheaper to stay here vs a downtown hotel and the uber ride(s) costs ($7-11 avg) during a weekend trip totally adds up to still be way less than what one would spend staying DT. (fyi- when we were researching, the avg. DT hotel was $250p/n +parking at $30-40p/n + no breakfast included). Just to give you a baseline for any cost comparisons...)

While I understand that's very convenient for a busy elementary school teacher, I just don't get what she sees in it beyond that. It's a convenient location, although the parking lot is inadequate at peak hours due to the dead-end drive thru. The interior is very neat with all the wood trim. The employees were very nice and helpful. But that's about it for the Pros. If the food were better, I would have no problem giving it 5 stars. It's not horrible food, but The Perfect Pear is far superior. it's just basic food, dressed up in a really nice setting. I got their signature dish - Croque Monsier.  First time to a restaurant, I always try to get a dish it's famous for. I really didn't see what the big deal was. It's basically a Monte-Cristo-type warm sandwich, no different than Chompies. My big complaint is when restaurants make these ''elite' sandwiches and the insides (meat, cheese, etc) are a big lump in the middle and the rest of the sandwich is plain bread because they couldn't take the time to actually spread out the ingredients so you'd get a good bite every time. The second big issue is since it's warm/heated, as it sits on the plate, the bottom can get soggy. Mine must have been sitting for a while because the bottom of the bread was mushy. Yuck. So their 'signature dish' was fairly tasteless, I had to spread the insides around with my finger, and it was soggy on the bottom. Triple Yuck. The pasta salad side was really good but the meal was already on the downside by that time. Or course I have a very small sample size of one visit and one dish, but it WAS a signature dish. Since my wife loves it, I'm sure I'll be going back, so I'll try the crepes next time and hopefully have better luck.",2.0

6mpdexlJQ-4WVjPw40xhog,"Paid a visit here after the JT concert on Friday night - best decision all weekend. Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.

The ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.

Our waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.",4.0

It appeared that they only had one small van/bus to use, but tons of extremely overpriced limos (but be prepared to pay $12+per person for a one way trip on the van.) The driver was very rude,impatient, and yelled at passengers. The majority of the hotel staff was extremely rude and unfriendly. Check-in/out was a long ordeal. The room was subpar. The mini-fridge didn't work, and if we wanted to empty it out to use for other stuff (we were there a week), it was going to cost $25, plus $50 for every day it was empty.Be super careful not to even touch something in it as it's electronically monitored and will charge you whether you drank/ate it or not. We spoke to a manager to have it fixed on the first day, they came to fix it an hour before our check out. The maid service was ridiculous (though we were informed they are contracted out). They barely cleaned the rooms, never replaced towels, threw the shampoos/soaps onto the counter and everyday came an hour earlier and would knock even with a do not disturb sign hanging.The first night we requested extra blankets, 2 hrs. later we still had no blankets, called down a second time and after 45 minutes, they brought up a thin, disgusting blanket.A few of the lights were burnt out, and once they were fixed, the room was still very dark. The couch (with hideaway bed) was outdated, ugly, falling apart and extremely uncomfortable. The entire casino and lobby smelled overpowering and horrid. The food (even for Vegas) is really overpriced and mediocre. The spa was just as bad, one lady even scolded us like children and literally yelled at us b/c we were self touring the locker rooms--even though we explained that the spa front desk attendant had told us to do so.  The hotel itself is a pain in the ass to navigate, to get to the guest elevators, you have to either navigate through the casino or through the shopping plaza. On a weekend night, forget it, with Club Tao there, the place is a madhouse and the entrance line takes up the entire foyer. We ate at I love Burgers, the staff was fantastic, but we all got really sick within hours of eating there. The ""resort fee"" doesn't include the fitness center.  For all of its reputation, The Venetian was extraordinarily disappointing. In fact, when it came time to gamble/shop, we went to other hotels. We were not about to give them any more of our money. While there, I ran into at least three other guests who had the same and worse problems as I did. Next trip to Vegas, we'll be staying elsewhere...perhaps the Bellagio, or MGM.",1.0
uesAtjiXZp1XscvnyyMDxg,"In the past I would have rated this restaurant 5 stars. We used to order from this place weekly. Lately, however, I have been disappointed in this place. 

The food is always five stars, that's in the event you are actually able to eat there. My wife and I enjoy eating at this place but realize that it is small, and often busy. Another option is take-out which we often opt for, because we live close, and can still enjoy the food at home. That hasn't been an option the last two attempts that I have made to order take-out because the line was busy. The first time it happened, I had to go to the restaurant, order the food, and wait 45 minutes to get the food. 
I tried again on Friday to order food, and again the line was busy. After many call attempts, my wife and I decided to see if we could get a table. When I got there I was told that there was a 35 minute wait for a table. I went into the bar to see if there were any tables available. There was one available, however a woman who was waiting for a table in the main dining room was occupying it. We decided to eat elsewhere.

ct-8XIkfru9vlXKYjS_tMg,"They have great quality stuff here.  I was escorted in by my brother who is more fashion forward than I am.  The staff was helpful selecting jeans that work best for me based on my descriptions.  Since I don't speak the fashion lingo, they had to interpret my words and find the right jeans for me.  The brands change, so if you know enough to be looking for something specific, maybe you should call ahead.

Basically, I was looking for something that would be stylish, but not so much so that it would be out of a style in 6 months.  When you're paying several $100-200 for jeans, you'd like to get some mileage out of them.

The staff was great explaining how the jeans would wear and break in.  They also were particular to explain how to wash them (or not wash them).  They also do free alterations, which I've never done for jeans, but makes total sense when you're trying these on.  We live out of town so they took our email and followed up a few days later with the tracking number on the package to arrive soon.  It's this extra bit of service that makes it worthwhile.

If you're thinking ""why would I pay so much for jeans?"", consider that these are the kind you'll wear all the time and will look great with the custom fit that comes with the tailoring.  If you're willing to pay several hundred for a suit that you wear to the occasional wedding or funeral, why not invest a little in your everyday wear?

RwyVgQdaZs8fKOr9D66Uhg,"Pros: 
I like the service.
Beautiful location.
Cons:
Food isn't outstanding for the price.
I felt that the food choices were redundant.
I got sick from the food.

It was wise of the head of my party to make a reservation at the Buffet at Bellagio. If we hadn't, we probably would've waited for 4 hours, and that is no exaggeration. Even WITH a reservation, we had an hour long wait before we were actually seated. It's a good thing I had someone with me or else I would've completely forgot that the reason I had gone to the Bellagio in the first place was to eat at the buffet...cause I would've wandered off and left without eating. Don't judge, I have a short attention span.

We sit down and are served our drinks (drinks aren't self-serviced). Finally, we get to go eat.
I got:
Beef sirloin steak
-4/5. It was really tough for being Med-rare. I liked the flavor, though.
Sushi
-1/5. Tasted like the sushi you get at Savemart or something. Eww.
Rice
-5/5. It's rice....
Sopas (beef)
-2/5. Tasted off and soggy.
Shrimp
-5/5. Plump and juicy.
Cheese Pizza
3.67568/5. It tasted alright. Got tired of it after awhile.
Creme Brulee
56709568409684/5. OH MY GOSH AMAZING
every single other dessert that I can't name:
1/5. Ew.

For a buffet, it didn't really have a HUGE selection of food (SHOCKER!). I was disappointed. 
That, and the food quality averaged at about 3/5. 

The food also made me really sick! This is coming from the person who took 2 laxatives once (don't ask) and didn't feel any pain, who eats popcorn with habanero sauce, who drinks Pepsi at 2 AM, you get the picture. Basically, I'm a goat.

I honestly don't understand why people stand in line for soooo long to eat here. And, it's quite pricey.

jpaCsJa3rCSDI-cgzNEZdg,"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of Sushi Ken's raw fish.

My husband and I judge whether we will re-visit a Japanese restaurant by the quality of its sashimi. Sashimi is usually the first thing we order in a Japanese restaurant, and sadly, it also often ends up being the last thing we had in most Japanese restaurants. Although sometimes we have to put up with skimpy pieces, rough uneven cuts, and fishy aftertaste, the husband and I are in our unwavering quest for the sashimi we want to come back for.

Then we found Sushi Ken, with its beautiful, thick-cut sashimi, thawed to a soft, buttery texture, and no fishy taste. Plus, reasonable price too. 

Because I have a soft spot for ramen noodles, I also ordered the combo of Tonkatsu noodle and beef curry for $11. The ramen is okey, probably not good enough for people from NYC or CA who are pampered by good Japanese restaurants. To me, it is satisfying because it is comfort food. I am forgiving as long as I can have one when I need one. 

The beef curry is quite generous in portion given it's like 3 bucks extra in addition to the ramen if you get them in combo. Again, it is not outstanding, but good enough for me.

I think service was great during the time we were there. Most servers were Japanese and were very friendly. The menu has a large selection of food. To us, they did one thing, and the most important thing right--sashimi. We will be back, soon.",5.0
fV7RAH7couJSy1ElerXMNA,"There are many good things about Costco and very few bad.  Let's get the bad out of the way first.  For years, Costco Tire Center was my goto for tires.  Then, the Michelin tires starting blowing up on me.  To be fair, I am hard on tires.  But blowouts are hard on vehicles, so I stopped getting tires at Costco. 

 I can't really think of much more bad, unless you consider they keep moving the inventory around, so you are always looking for that stuff you bought last time, because it's not where it was before.  Sometimes when you see that thing that you just gotta have, but cannot really afford it?  Well, you better bite, because it may not be there the next time.  Prices are great, but you have to buy in bulk.  This is okay for things that will keep, but stuff like bread and pastries- you better really like because you are either gonna get tired of them or they spoil.  I use a vacuum sealer for stuff I don't think will last.

I like that you can get more organic stuff now.  We buy as much organic as we can afford, and Costco is good for things like Half/half and eggs.  We go through a lot of half and half.  Gas?  you bet.  Always priced great. Anyway, been going here for years and I highly recommend Costco.",5.0
yDtXaBaocPWjqSkGhxHcIg,"It's true. Severance Hall is one of the most beautiful concert halls not just in America, but the entire world. It was completed during the Great Depression and features a majestic classical façade that hints at the Art Deco grandeur that lies inside.

Throughout the interior, you'll find lots of aluminum accents because the Severances were friends with the founder of Alcoa, and lots of lotus blossom motifs, a nod to Elizabeth Severance's favorite flower. The breathtaking, soaring grand foyer is filled with dozens of Italian marble columns and additional bronze, brass, and marble adornments. You can imagine it as the perfect setting for an event or reception involving lots of formal waltzing.

If you haven't already spent lots of time gawking in admiration at the aforementioned public spaces, you'll be immediately drawn, upon entering the concert hall, to its glittering aluminum ceiling, with intricate detailing that, according to legend, evokes the lace patterns of Elizabeth Severance's wedding dress. You'll also notice the grand 6,000-pipe organ behind the stage.

Although the hall didn't have the best acoustics when it first opened, it underwent significant improvements under legendary conductor George Szell, plus additional renovations in anticipation of the year 2000, creating an acoustically magnificent space that complements the aural firepower of what many consider to be America's finest orchestra. Well worth a visit, particularly as a patron of the Cleveland Orchestra and/or special events like the Cleveland International Piano Competition.",5.0
Apt0OtuZiavHNB2aFcPt_Q,"I've come here on previous visits, and was looking forward to the Fire Ball  Wings.  Unfortunately, they are no longer on the menu and were replaced with regular buffalo wings.   They were small and very average.  Providing a tasty dipping sauce with the wings doesn't compensate for small blah wings you could find anywhere.  We went back again 2 days later and tried the Trash Can Nachos.  Ours looked nowhere like the picture and was overloaded with a nasty tasting cheese that overpowered the entire dish.  I never thought I'd use the words 'too much cheese', but this was just nasty.  $20 Nachos should at least taste great. I'll upload a picture of them after posting this review.

Onto the good.....

We had Spicy Bloody Mary's on both visits.  Worth the $15 price each and huge. It's a little inconsistent on toppings, but nonetheless really good.

Service was a little slow on my first visit, but after seeing the Bloody Mary, I understood why It took a little longer, and I was fine with that.

The take.......

Bring those Fire Ball wings back.  Why would you even take something so good off the menu, only to replace them with something people can get anywhere?

Either revisit the Trashcan Nachos recipe, or revisit the staff that are making it.  Who would ever expect Nachos to be bad?  How do you screw that up?  That cheese is pungent nasty.",2.0

I ordered a test dress that arrived quickly in the mail. I ordered 4 more dresses for the rest of my bridal party at the beginning of May and was told that they were currently on preorder because they didn't have enough in stock. That was fine, I was willing to wait, and when I called at the beginning of June, I was told that they would be ready to ship at the end of the month. When they hadn't arrived by July, I called again and was told that there had been a delay but they would definitely be ready to ship by the end of the month. When I called again at the beginning of August, I was again told that they would be ready to ship at the end of the month. At which point I cancelled my $900 order that included bandeaus and groomsmen accessories since I wasn't confident that they would be able to fill my order in time.

We went looking for those ""intelligent"" dog toys... you know, the puzzle type deals where they have to figure it out to get the treats. They listed about a dozen of them on their website.

The girl at the front looked like she was about to leap the counter and chase me down, because we headed into the warehouse and I didn't hear her go ""Ma'am? Ma'am?!""  the first time. (GRAH, don't call me ""ma'am"", I'm only 21, dammit!)   
When I did hear her and turn around, she told me I had to leave my purse up front, which REALLY, REALLY ticked me off. I carry a very expensive bag and it usually has a very expensive phone and wallet full of cash in it. I do not let it out of my sight, ever. Ask any girl - being asked to leave your purse with someone just makes us uncomfortable. 

Aside to the owner/managers:
Dear Ryan's, I'm sorry you have been stolen from, but that's a hard fact of retail business. Maybe 1 in 500 people will steal and it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be, ya cheapskates. You can absorb a $3 toy here and there. It's really insulting to be treated as untrustworthy and a criminal when you haven't done anything.

(The purse bit set the tone for the whole trip). 

The place was very dim (I know it's a warehouse, but it shouldn't be a 2/5 on the light intensity scale).

The prices were maybe $1.50 below retail stores at the most. It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10 minutes away, sure. 

There were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed miffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we were down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing at the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when the girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super creepy.

80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's mouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he needs tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it. I saw nothing truly suitable, unless we somehow missed it (and we walked through twice).

To top it off, they only carried 3 of the puzzle type toys, when they showed a dozen on their website. Nothing like driving to central Phoenix from Scottsdale and not having what you came for. Again, we looked everywhere in the warehouse and didn't see any more.

We left with the ""Dog Tornado"" (which is quite fun) and a knotted rope that looked pretty tough, but my dog has had it for about 30 minutes and has chewed halfway through the knot in the middle... Le sigh.",2.0

They didn't show up to the first appointment. I send them an e mail and they say they will be there the next day. Didn't show up to the second appointment! Two no call no shows is amazing, any job will fire you after one. I Send another e mail and they casually tell me someone will be there tomorrow (no apology just a excuse about someone getting held up at another job). So repair guys show up around 545pm the next day and are gone by 6 (still hour and a half of day light) without saying a word. They opened the filter to drain and left it there. So of course I send another e mail, which didn't get a response.I have been left with that for two days so it looks like Im now stuck doing the job myself. A simple task like cleaning a filter or possibly changing the grids, which should take one day, is now into day 9! 

A little lesson in customer service for these guys. I'll keep it really simple, like Walmart or any other minimum wage customer service first week job training simple. Lesson 1 is reliability, when you say you are going to be there to service a filter BE THERE. If something comes up so you can't be there let the customer know. Lesson 2 empathy, after missing an appointment or making a mistake you should let the customer know that you understand what they are going through and that you wouldn't want to be treated that way either. Lesson 3 ownership or the buck stops here rule, anyone in the company should be able to say ""I can help you out"". In fact saying ""my guy got held up at another job"" is exactly what you shouldn't do, especially if you're the owner like in this case.

The tempura bits really made the bowl come together and taste more savoury. So if you build your own bowl, don't forget the tempura bits! 

The wasabi tuna fell kind of short for me especially because it wasn't spicy enough and a bit more bland when comparing with the salmon. I did enjoy the seaweed salad that part of the wasabi tuna though so next time I'd just add that to the classic salmon.

i've been here on two occasions and ordered food on both, as well as an iced americano and regular iced tea.  the first time we grabbed a table inside and my friend and i split the vito's favorite in a wrap. it was $8 of pure italian deliciousness. packed with lettuce, tomatoes, salami, ham, and much more. it was huge, a half was more than enough. the side of cole slaw had pepper in it which gave it kind of a kick that i've never experienced in a cole slaw before. the second time i went i had the greek wrap which wasn't as good as vito's favorite but still packed a kick ass greek punch.  

the coffee is good, i was chatting with the [assumed] owner and he mentioned he gets the beans roasted especially for him from the cave creek coffee company. it was brought out to my table with cream and sugar and was perfectly bitter with a hint of sweet earthiness.  the iced tea was average, it's not brewed cup by cup but they charge you like they do. 

they close at 9 during the week which sucks, because i procrastinate til it gets dark and then trip out into study mode, and have a hard time finding a good place to grab a bite, cup of coffee, and focus. i find it to be a laid back place to get work done and bust out that 10-15 page research paper you put off until the day before it was due. FOCUS. get off yelp, and get to work!!!!!

*note: for those who live north of mcdowell, you have to go one block south of mcdowell and use that to get around to 3rd ave which is a one way street going north.  the parking lot on the southwest corner is open to hob nobs customers as well as the parking lot directly behind it.",4.0

It said the order would be ready in 30 minutes and so I arrived 20 minutes after I ordered it, expecting to wait a few minutes after I found a parking spot (no easy feat on S. Craig St.). When I got inside and told the lady at the counter that I was picking up a takeout order, she said they still had not received it. As I was calling GrubHub customer service, she ""happened"" to find it as I got through to an agent and rushed it to the kitchen. I asked the agent to look into it and admittedly the order failed to be delivered the first two times, whether due to a failing on GrubHub's part or Yuva's part, I do not know. However, it was confirmed that the order had made it through ten minutes earlier.

At long last, when we had our food and made it home, we tried the food and were utterly disappointed. The samosas were poor compared to others I have had, a tough maneuver to pull off given they are usually frozen samosas anyhow. We also had bhaigan bhartha and kofta curry (known at authentic Indian places as malai kofta), both of which were a major disappointment. I have had malai kofta at many different Indian restaurants and this was the least flavorful I have ever experienced. The bhaigan bhartha, on the other hand, was charred so much that the smoke level nearly exceeded every Scotch in existence. We requested that both be made spicy and neither were.

My plus one ordered us some strawberry jalapeno margarita , and those were perfectly spicy & sweet. Our server Kayla (who was freaking amazing!!) told us about some locally brewed beers they have on tap, and sold me on the Koffee Kolsch, which was like a cold brewed coffee, smelt delish and tasted great, you got the full flavor of caramel and hazelnut , this was a great tasting beer!

We had dinner catered by Top Golf,  it consisted of Pickled Fried Chicken, Slow Smoked Beef Brisket, Green Chili Mac & Cheese, House Baked Beans, freshly baked rolls, salad & the fixings and bbq sauce, pickled onions & slaw and unlimited water, sodas, teas & coffee.

The pickled fried chicken was pretty good chicken, the freshly baked buns with the beef brisket topped with pickled onions & slaw drizzled in the bbq was the bomb.com. I had high hopes for the green chili mac & cheese, but sadly it was the loser of the night, not only did it seem to not have the cheese, it was bland, no flavor, no salt, and yes you saw the green chili, but even they lacked the flavor. Just say no to the green chili mac & cheese, everything else is great!

Now on the golfing, we had about 10 bays reserved, and after some great help from TopGolf staff we were all set up and ready to play, I have to tell you, I didn't really think this was going to be that fun, but boy oh boy was I wrong! I think I have found my game, such a rush hitting the ball and watching it fly and land in one of colored goals!  I was channeling my inner Tiger Woods! So much fun!

I need good deals, and these are some great deals! 

I also had my bachelorette party here. It was incredibly hard to get a hold of someone to plan the event. We finally did make set plans and when we got there the spread was incredible. It was only $30 per person with heavy appetizers, dessert and 2 complimentary drinks. Plus they have a very large private section for large parties, so it was nice to have our own little space.

I've been frequenting this spa for many years and always receive a great massage & great service, hence why I always come back. Kerry is great, Heather is great and my fiancé said that Sarah was great. Unforunately, yesterday was one of the worst massages I've ever had. :( It felt very rushed and didn't quite feel like a ""professional"" massage. I think my therapist Kyra forgot to trim her nails because I could feel her nails digging into the back of my neck and that's all I could think about. I always get deep tissue massages so my pain tolerance is high. I carry a lot of tension in my shoulders and neck area and we both have issues with our sciatic. After my massage, I asked Kyra of possible techniques that I could do to alleviate some of the tension and her best reply was ""to drink water or lots of lemon water"". Thankfully, Sarah was very helpful and literally showed us a few good stretches to help other than drinking lemon water. In addition, hours after my massage, I had a little discomfort in the back of my neck. I had my fiancé look at the back of my neck and he saw a pretty decent size scratch on my neck, from where Kyra was digging with her nails. 

In addition, they forgot to give us locals discount and the bottled waters were warm, there was no ice and the bins for the robes and towels were overflowing.

uZBfVhBQyeJELm1z2enR0w,"Ok more like 3.5 stars. 

I try to be as impartial as possible when trying a new place, but I'm not quite sure what's going on with this place. We arrived around 12:30pm and expected a lunch rush. The place was mostly empty, maybe 6 tables out of 17 had customers dining. With two other parties in front of us, we were told we had to put our names on a list and wait to be seated. It only took 5 minutes to be seated, but given that so many tables were empty, waiting at all seemed odd. 

The hostess is very friendly and delivered menus and took our order quickly. We ordered pho and a bahn mi sandwich and were given the usual plate of condiments to go with it, but it was missing the Thai basil and cilantro. When we asked about it, the server said they recently started omitting these items from the plate and only served them if customers asked. So that is a little weird to me too. 

My dining companion was served her soup several minutes before my sandwich came out, which is also when the iced coffee I had ordered at the start came out. Also weird. 

But as for the food, the bahn mi sandwich rolls are HUGE. Like...American football sized. And they are GOOD! They were a little skimpy on the jalapeños, but I understand not everyone has a mouth made of asbestos like mine. 

All in all worth it for the food, but the service is just a little weird, which is the only reason for the 3 stars.",3.0

Most of the clothes I was sorting through were swanky  label names I've seen time and time again and they had a pretty sweet shoe selection including Kenneth Cole, Nine West and other quality names. Their furniture selection is sick as well---the entire front of the store is loaded up with furniture and I wanted to plop down on one of the love seats and kick up my heels on the matching ottoman! They have a different tag of the day sale which leaves anything with that color tag 50% off and every Wednesday ALL clothes are 50%. Gotta love brand nice prices for super cheap.

And a large and very filling crepe! 

Hazelnut/banana - I thoroughly enjoyed this hearty crepe and by the time I finished, I was stuffed! Full of banana chunks and generous layer of Nutella. Every bite was oozing with it, and the light, airy cream complimented the crepe perfectly. Comes with candied hazelnuts but I nixed that. $11

Blueberry lemon - giant blueberries on top of the crepe! Looked so fresh and delicious. No mushy blueberries here. But my husband was not a fan of this crepe, because of the lemon curd filling. There was no texture, and to him it seemed a bit gooey. He said the crepe itself was tasty and was not overly sweet. $11.25

The food however was disappointing to say the least. I ordered the corn beef hash which was moderately priced for Vegas food. The plate came out with an unpleasant liquid along the bottom of it and it just got soaked into the potatoes. The corn beef had as much flavor as a piece of cotton. It was terrible.

From their menu and toppings, to the experience at pick-up and then the actual pie itself, everything was excellent and of superior quality.

When I picked up the pie the woman behind the counter asked me if I was a new customer, she then shouted to the kitchen, using my name, that I was new and everyone cheered saying ""hi/welcome Tiffany"". She then offered me an order of free garlic knots to try as a first time customer.

I was desperate for a new pharmacy after getting fed up with the big chains taking forever and over-charging.  So even though I saw the bad reviews of this one, I wanted to give them a shot anyway.  They are just as awful, if not worse, than the previous reviewers said.  

I have medication that I have to take due to a serious condition that isn't visible just by looking at me.  It causes severe chronic pain and I've been on pain meds for over 5 years - but I'm young so I generally look healthy.  I dropped off a refill here on a Thursday morning and was told they could fill it for me on Saturday morning.  Ok, fine.  I come back Saturday morning and they say, Oh, we can't fill it for you because your doctor never called us back to verify.  So it's a Saturday morning and I obviously can't get in touch with my doctor and NOW they tell me??  NO ONE from the pharmacy called me since Thursday or I would have gladly called the doctor myself yesterday and had them get in touch.  No one bothered.  So I tried to explain this to the pharmacist, Keith, and he immediately decided I'm a pain pill junkie and drug addict - and he basically even said so, comparing me to a heroin addict.  My husband was with me and he was so shocked he was literally speechless.  Extremely rude, extremely poor customer service, not to mention extremely hurtful.  The owners/managers/whoever will be getting a letter from me shortly.

We sat at the bar, and the place was pretty packed after a recent concert and it was happy hour as well. Service was actually really quick. All staff was friendly.  

We went with a margarita pie because it was 50% off...and now I know why.  I am not a fan of thin crust. I don't like picking up what seems like a tortilla and having all the toppings fold over. Being a margarita pizza, obviously there are not many toppings on it.  The sauce was rancid. It was like they took a can of tomato paste and slathered it all over the tortilla like crust.  Cheese was good, as was the fresh chopped basil, but what a waste of good toppings on a crappy crust and sauce.  I never liked the thin crust/tortilla like crusts that PT's group has.

The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.  

It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.  

We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.  What a terrible, awful experience.",1.0

It is hidden away in an office park and has lots of parking. Both inside the restaurant and the outdoor seating looked very nice, but since it was a nice day we sat outside. I loved sitting on the couch area with lots of pillows. Our waiter was very nice and patient with us (we were very indecisive with our food!) and gave us good recommendations when we asked. 

I tried the chicken dish and it was probably the best chicken ever! It was so tasty and fell apart so easily so it was easy to pickup. There was also some sort of macaroni and cheese sorta dish, which was okay. I wasn't too crazy about the macaroni and cheese though the chicken changed my life! After our lunch, we had three cheeses which were extremely yummy as well.

Overall, the service was great (I never had an empty glass), the food was amazing (everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and had leftovers to bring home), and ambiance was relaxing. I definitely would like to return on my next trip back to Vegas.

Their banchan (side dishes) are not the best honestly. They tend to be a little on the dry side because they're sitting in open cafeteria food trays.

su--mvFiMt6KYY-rMlwiSQ,"I had a few hours to spare before my flight so I went on Yelp and searched for best lunch in Phoenix. Little Miss BBQ was near the top of the list with 5 stars and over 600 reviews. I pulled into the parking lot at 10:45 AM and saw there were at least 30 people on line and the parking lot was full. I had a feeling I stumbled into something magical. I was the first in line to wait for a spot. Little did I know that this special place in line would allow me to talk for about half an hour with Denny and hear the entire story behind Little Miss BBQ. I also learned that since it was Thursday, I was in for a treat because there was pastrami! After sampling the brisket and sausage, I truly felt that divine intervention led me here. Scott's enthusiasm and passion for his food is instantly contagious! I knew I needed to share this experience with my husband, but didn't know if I could get the food through airport security and back home to FL. Scott offered to vacuum seal my order so I could pack it in my suitcase. I was looking around to see if there were any video cameras and everyone was on their best behavior because they were being recorded. Nope, just a regular Thursday at Little Miss BBQ. I must have sat at my table for over an hour savoring every magical bite of ""fatty"" brisket, ""fatty"" pastrami and jalapeño cheddar grits. I couldn't tell you how their sauces taste because I didn't dare interfere with the flavor party already going on in my mouth. Scott and Denny both checked on me while I was sitting there to make sure I was enjoying my experience. I didn't ever want to leave. I felt like a VIP even though I was just a regular customer. Scott helped me pack up my leftovers. I took my leftovers along with my vacuum sealed to-go order And headed to the airport with grease on my chin and a huge smile on my face. When I returned the rental car, the attendant asked how my day was and I gushed about my lunch experience. He jokingly asked me if I brought him any and I handed him my leftovers. Felt blessed and grateful that I was able to pay it forward. So the short story is that I went somewhere for lunch and ended up with an unexpected life changing culinary experience. Not bad for a Thursday!",5.0

NiRNmFYc-8TgjNgVetGKZw,"This is a solid buffet - not the absolute premier or best, but they have a ton of redeeming qualities that keep me coming back here.

It ended up being $48 total - $32 for the food and $15ish for AYCD. One of the things I really like about this buffet is they don't ""put the clock"" on you, so to speak. Lots of other places either enforce a hard 2-hour time limit on drinking or start not-so-subtly shoving you out the door around that time. I like to take my time, eat at least 3-4 plates, and enjoy my alcohol instead of just slamming stuff down. On my most recent visit this past Saturday, we were here for 3.5 hours. I was able to enjoy my food and mimosas so much more this way, and it felt much more relaxed for my admittedly hungover and slightly lethargic brain.

Wait time can get really, really bad, but at 11 am this past Saturday am, it was only a 20 minute wait. Admittedly, it is wintertime and therefore off season, so I'm sure this isn't always the case.

While their food isn't necessarily over-the-moon incredible like some of the other buffets, they have plenty of delicious if basic offerings. The omelette station was fun and line wasn't too long, the peppercorn-crusted meat offering was delicious although a little too rare for my taste, and the veggie covered pizza was awesome. They had a cheese ravioli in some sort of insane vodka sauce, which was my favorite I think, and their mountains of crab legs were a fun group bonding activity. Sorry to the gentleman I hit with part of a leg shell while cracking a particularly difficult leg. They also have a good amount of Asian-inspired offerings, including decent sushi and pork buns. Their desserts left a little to be desired; the macaroons were pretty but lacked much flavor; their cheesecake was underwhelming, and the pumpkin tart was also not the best. 

Our waitress was adorable, and in my experience the waitstaff here is always awesome. The coffee is delicious, and service was prompt to fill up the water, coffee, and mimosas. They also set down the OJ on your table and pour the champagne for you, letting you choose how much/how little OJ you want in your drink. As someone who mostly just likes OJ ""for color"", I really like this perk.

Overall, recommend as the number-one buffet for a more chill, relaxed vibe for a leisurely brunch; if you want the wow-factor type food, I would recommend going elsewhere. Depends what you're looking for.",4.0

It has in my opinion and experience fallen from what I once would have given it a 5 star a few years back but no more.  I thought maybe I had a bad day a few months ago and thought Id go again and give them another try.  I love Korean food, especially Kalbi in the dinner entree so this is what I orders for lunch...at $22 bucks its not cheap.  Kalbi is not a very tender cut to begin with because it is connective tissue but got this for lunch and the first three pieces were nothing but grizzle...which tells me it didnt get heated at a high enough temp or a bad cut of meat.  So I told the server to take it back and I ordered a Bulgogi in its place.  While waiting I knibbled on the little Kimchi dishes and rice.  When the entree was brought I asked if she could refill 2 or 3 of the Kimchi dishes and she said it would an extra cost...about a spoons full of vegetables.  So this kinda set me off and told her I have been coming there for 10 years and all...never charged an additional for replenishing the Kimchi dishes and I asked for the bill...paid the $18 plus dollars for three pieces of grizzle, a table spoons worth of rice and two teaspoons of cabbage...told them Id never be back.

We saw the review for Johnny Rockets and couldn't pass up the onion rings.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but probably not good enough to deserve an extra star.  Call me a foodie, but I want something to really wow my taste buds.

On the overall, this place had an awesome atmosphere.  It was a bit early, maybe 10 or 11am, so not too many people.  At each table they have a small Jukebox, and when you sit down your waiter or waitress gives you five nickels so that you can pick some music (songs are only 5 a selection).

I ordered the Route 66 burger (mushroom burger) and my brother ordered some bacon burger.  I saw a sign in the restaurant that recommended my choice, but it was definitely a let down.  Not much flavor.  Sorta greasy, but lack of any flavor sorta killed it.  Actually, it was one of the worst mushroom burgers I've had, don't know how they screwed that one up.

Now my brother loved his bacon burger, and I had a bite.  It was really good.  I guess I should never underestimate the power of bacon.  We never got a chance for a milkshake though, as the burgers were pretty filling.

Last thing I should mention though is the dancing.  I think that everyone can agree two white boys getting down to Funky Town is hilarious, but for the whole song is a little much.  We felt so bad for them we left some extra tip.  Johnny Rockets, why can't you hire women to dance to music for our pleasure?  Why did it have to be men?  I probably would have added an extra star for female amusement.

The check-in can be confusing because it's all done at a kiosk and during an emergency the last thought on your mind is to walk into an ER only to have your first contact be with a kiosk instead of a human.

The ordering process is kind of neat with this establishment employing waitresses in a casse-croûte style of joint. The service was very kind and helpful. We had a few young children with us and they accommodated us nicely. 

After 10 minutes our meals were served and I literally destroyed my steak sandwich as I was famished. The submarine was very good with high quality fresh ingredients. My only qualm was the bread being too small to hold it all together. I hate needing to cut my subs into smaller segments or have it risk being ruined with needless spillage while it is being transitioned from the plate, to my hands until its final destination... my stomach. The quality of the bread must be better and my favorite subs are those with bread made with potato dough for extra flavor. Either way, it was pretty good. Typical as it gets.

The poutine itself was between good and very good. A staple of classic casse-croûte style poutine found in many local institutions across the province.

There is an admission fee ($7.50) which initially turned me off, but once I saw all the people wandering through the farm grabbing apples off of the trees and eating them, I realized they must do this to cover their ass.  So I didn't feel bad when I also picked an apple to sample to see if I liked that kind.  The rows are clearly labeled, and we were there the first day of ambrosias, which are sweet and delicious.  The apples looked really small and so I assumed they'd be tart, but they were so juicy and sweet.  

You can get a wagon ride out to where all the apples haven't been picked yet, this can be a bit of a boring waiting process but it is a fun ride.  They didn't tell us when they'd be back to get us but it was about 40 minutes or so (next time I'd ask because it was a bit odd to wonder when they'd be back!).

uCnEqsIDozNk6XKr0MJNCg,"We went last night for AZ Restaurant Week...I really like the atmosphere, much bigger than I thought it would be!  We had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  I got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.  I don't think I have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.

If you're looking for a place to get consistently delicious fair trade coffee?  You've found it!

If you're looking for a place to get consistent costumer service?
Not so much.

I live right around the corner from Thieves, so I want to love it so bad.  It's the closest coffee shop to my house and, like I said, has great fair trade coffee. But Thieves keeps inconsistent hours and the barristas (owner included) seem uninterested in serving you.  Which, attitude aside, just makes everything take longer.

Here's my anecdotal evidence: The first time I went to Thieves, when I got there, there was no one behind the counter.  I'd heard mixed reviews about getting served, so I thought I'd do an experiment and see how long it took.  After standing around for 7 minutes (and contemplating grabbing the cash register or one of those tasty croissants and making a run for it) a gentlemen who I now recognize as the owner reappeared (from the basement? outside? it was unclear.)  He moseyed over the counter where I was standing and took some time getting set up before looking up and saying, ""What can I get you?""   No ""Have you been waiting long?"" or ""Sorry about that, I had to go and deal with an invasion of panthers downstairs!"" or another plausible explanation.  I ordered my coffee, it was delicious.

pqSL-XjBc8HjbymUcOTS5g,"I am a regular Hertz customer, so to try another rental car company is a rare occurrence. However, for my most recent trip to Scottsdale, AZ I went with Payless.  Why?  Because Hertz wanted $180 for a 1 day rental and Payless gave me a rate of $29!  Seriously!

My expectations were very low as I've rented from Payless before and wasn't too impressed.  I booked my reservation online via Expedia.  I took the airport shuttle from baggage claim to the car rental center which is a couple of miles away from the airport.

It was easy to find Payless, they're located at the middle-left side of the rental center sharing a space with Fox Rent a Car.  When I arrived, there was 1 person in line at Payless and 20 people in line at Fox....I think the people at Fox were jealous of how quickly we were able to get assistance...ha!

The check-in process was pretty fast, but it was a little frustrating having to give all of my information again....I guess their reservation system is not interfaced with Expedia because they didn't have any of my personal info and had to manually input it.

After a short wait, I was given my contract and told to take the escalator down to the 1st floor where the Payless cars were located.  When I got to the 1st floor I went to the car rental desk which had 5 employees and 1 customer at the counter.  1 employee was helping the customer while the other 4 employees had a conversation that was too important to breakup and come help me.  After a ""are you going to f_cking help me?"" look from me to one of them they broke it up and came over to assist.

They gave me the keys to my car, a Honda Civic, and I went on my way.  The car was really nice and drove well.  It had a lot of power and room despite being a compact car.  Easily the best compact rental car I've driven.

M20FSjFcPrjiZl1NjTV57g,"I found the EZ Medical Store online after my parents confirmed they'd be visiting, and I knew I'd need a wheelchair for my Dad.  Located conveniently near Hwy 60 and Cooper Road, it is in a small industrial building across the street from a nice shopping complex.  I was relieved to learn that EZ Medical Store offers medical equipment for rent or purchase, and that the rental fees for a wheelchair were convenient and reasonable ($35 for a week).  

Even better, they had so many wheelchairs in stock that it was not even necessary for me to reserve a wheelchair in advance. The first time I rented a wheelchair, I walked into the Store, provided my personal information and credit card, and walked out with a wheelchair.  One of the helpful attendants showed me how to open and close the wheelchair for storage, and then carried the wheelchair out to my car for me and placed it into the car (THANK YOU!).  

I was happy enough with the service to rent from them a second time, and this time, one of the managers suggested a scooter rental instead of a wheelchair and so I took home a scooter instead. 

At first, I had been concerned that there would be no way I could get a scooter into my small car, but the manager showed me how easy it was to take apart, and how difficult to break (Ms. Fumbly Fingers here.).  He showed me how to use it, and then with his guidance I took it apart and put it into the trunk of my car (small Toyota) myself so I'd remember how to break it down for transport.

The real win, the real reason I went to Easy Medical Store made itself apparent when I surprised my Dad with a scooter instead of a wheelchair.  His eyes literally lit up, and the next day, he asked if he could take the scooter for a spin outside, and spend time outside walking with our family.  What a huge relief.  He proceeded to use the scooter nearly every day, which was a relief to our family.  Seeing him active, feeling empowered driving a scooter instead of a wheelchair, and having him get some sun on his face for a couple of days was very important for all of us.  

Had it not been for Easy Medical Store, I would never have considered a scooter, because I thought it would be too big and too expensive for us to manage.  But, it made a big difference for my Dad and my family.  You can't buy moments like that - Thanks Easy Medical Store.",5.0

Flavor wise, the fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired. They are more icy than ice-creamy. So I don't tend to get those much. The pistachio and chocolate amaretto are my two favorite flavors though. I go back to them the most. I have also enjoyed butterfinger, just because I love butterfingers. Most of the other flavors are good as well.

Now, I have to admit that the food is quite good here, and worthy of the many glowing reviews being bandied about.

We started with a ""Family Style Canoe"" which featured crunchy golden style lobster potstickers, sesame seared shrimp, grilled Szechuan pork ribs, and blackened island ahi. Everything on this appetizer boat was very good, but the ribs were absolutely amazing! I pretty much scoffed down all four ribs that were on the plate - sorry everyone who didn't get one!

There were four plates offered as entrees. As a main entree I ordered the ""Hibachi Grilled Salmon"" which came with a Japanese citrus ponzu. The salmon was prepared perfectly, and was a great choice for one trying to eat healthy while on the road.

Of course, it's not all about having no fun, as I had to try the ""Dessert Sampler Plate"". Each plate came with three mini desserts. Yeah, I ate all three. Can't remember much of what they were, maybe a cheesecake thing, and a chocolate thing, but all were eaten happily.

The staff here is on-point. Everyone I encountered were more than helpful and highly courteous. Our room was nicely appointed and they even had a special menu printed up for our company event which added a personal touch.

We were greeted promptly at the restaurant and were seated with a small cluster of other diners. We could have used some space but that is OK.

My steak was delicous, tender, cooked to perfection and I liked the open face style of the garlic toast underneath and the crispy onions on top for taste and texture. The steak cut as if it were butter. The prime rib sandwich was alright but clearly, my sandwich won out and my husband had wished he had ordered differently! Once the server took our order, we never saw him again at our table. A woman server brought us our meals and then disappeared as well until she helped serve the next table, and the next table.

He apologized for us being 'neglected' and gave us a tour of the restaurant. He seemed to take responsibility for this particular server's shortcomings and this was a refreshing change. His top notch service at the end went a long way in realizing that mistakes do happen and we would likely go back especially for that top of the line, rare steak.",4.0

We did have their standard suite, but was great enough! A very nice sitting area, complete with a big comfy couch to relax on. Just sunk right into the bed at the end of the day. Lots of closet room and dresser space, and the bathroom was amazing! Wonderful shower and a very large soaking tub. Kind of wished I had a chance to check out that tub! ;p ~

The guest serves were excellent and a late night stroll around the Palazo was magnificent! The hotel itself is amazingly designed and makes you feel like royalty. The pools and hot tub were worth the time out from a day exploring just to relax and take in the gardens surrounding them. Just wear sandels, the concrete is HOT!!

The restaurants at the Venetian sounded very enticing, although we never did eat here. We did manage to sneak in a Gondola ride! Cheesy yes. Touristy...you bet!! But worth every minute!! And their voices are amazing!

We arrived for our 8:15pm reservation and were promptly taken to to our table.
Out knowledgeable server, Kenneth, gave us a great run down of the entire menu.
For a table of two we ordered the following to share:
Mac N Cheese: It was super cheesy and amazing we had it come out first like a mini appetizer.
Short Ribs: They came with green beans, corn, and mashed potatoes. This meal was good but didn't compare to the chicken.
Chicken and Waffles with Watermelon: Order this! The chicken was so moist and flavorful. The watermelon added something different and the waffles and bourbon syrup were great also! The portion was pretty large.

Overall it was a great experience! The food, service, and ambiance made it a nice relaxing evening! 

Tips: 
Call early for a reservation! If they say they are booked for the night check Open Table!

jhpMEBgMEqdeGXb8HdxKgA,"Being from Hawaii, I'm always excited to find food inspired by the islands. We have visited Da Valley Grill three times now, and we have enjoyed each time. The location is a little hard to find. If you weren't looking for it, you would never know it existed as it's located in an industrial-looking business center. We drove past it the first time we went. 

On our first visit, the hubby ordered my all-time favorite plate lunch, Chicken Katsu. It was lightly pan-fried and was nice and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The accompanying sauce was a little different that I have been used to, as it's a little on the sweeter side. I'm used to a more smoky favor, but it was still tasty. So we could try another item on the menu, I ordered the Kalua Pig. It was flavorful, tender, juicy, and not too salty. The plates are served with two scoops of rice and one side (macaroni salad, potato salad, or coleslaw). On the second visit, the hubby again went with the Chicken Katsu, while I ordered their Kahuku Shrimp (mostly because my dad is a Kahuku High School alum, lol). The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice, spicy kick to it. On our most recent visit, I couldn't pass up the Chicken Katsu yet again, so we both ordered it this time. 

While the restaurant is small, it is clean and has plenty of seating. Service has been friendly and consistent. I wish their saimin was served all day, rather than just during breakfast (7-10am weekdays, none on Saturday) as it is one of the foods I miss most from the islands.",4.0
VA-sjfsdhpE7j_01EnuabA,"I'll admit this from the outset, the fifth star is primarily due to the fact that my beloved Steelers call this their home. If I was rating purely with my mind and not my heart, this would be a four or 3.5 star review (I round up on yelp.) 

On our trip to Pittsburgh, we opted to take the $8 public tour on Friday Oct. 7. This was the only day during our trip a tour was available, for understandable reasons. We arrived early, more than the requested 15 minutes and there was already quite a line. Or at least a couple of different lines, and no one was really sure what was happening. Turns out a tour group that had been scheduled for an earlier tour (students from a local school) was late, causing a major disruption. In fact, they still had people running in AFTER the 10 am tour start time. This caused the tour guides to be quite discombobulated, and the public tours to start late. A minor inconvenience, and not necessarily the fault of Heinz Field or their staff/volunteers, but it definitely didn't start the day off right. 

Once the tour got started, it wasn't too bad. They split the larger group into several smaller ones (still about 40-50 people each) and headed out and around the field. I don't know if it's because they were rushing to make the time back up or what, but there were MANY times the groups ran into each other or got confused during the tour. It seems there could have been better organization there. That being said, the tour moves fast, but does allow you time to take pictures, etc. You see various parts of the seating area, the scoreboards, the press boxes, the luxury boxes and my favorite part - the locker rooms and the field. During this time, you get a lot of information that you can probably find on google, with a little personal commentary from the tour guide's experiences thrown in. 

Overall, for a Steelers fan (and one guy married to a Steelers fan) it was an enjoyable experience, despite the organizational snafus. Definitely worth the $8 (which, compared to other stadium tours I've experienced is very reasonable.)",5.0

It would have been more, but I refused the recommended wheel alignment. This is only my opinion, but unless my car is handling badly or I notice unusual tire wear, I always skip this costly recommendation. I found a website on the internet that stated,  ""It takes a lot to knock your car out of alignment; your average run-of-the-mill pothole won't do it."" If your interested in reading the entire article you can find it at: 

http://www.roadandtravel.com/carcare/alignment.html

In all fairness there may be other websites that have a different view of the necessity of wheel alignment. 

They did talk me into a brake fluid exchange, which again in my opinion is questionable. I wish I would have checked the fluid myself before agreeing, that was my fault. They charged $159.95 for the brake fluid exchange.

For comparison, I also went to Wicked Spoon of the Cosmopolitan. Bellagio definitely has a wider selection, but loses in the uniqueness category. 

The pros:
-Good sushi selection/quality. I murdered a whole school of fish during my consumption of salmon sushi. 
-Decent seafood variety
-Numerous red meats available. -1 point for the abysmal kobe beef. How embarrassing. 
-Delicious creme brulee. Inhaled at least 5 of these. 

The cons:
-Front end staff. 
-Limited ""speciality"" items and ethnic food. 
-Besides the creme brulee, desserts were mediocre.

Waitresses/waiters will be at your bay to take your food/beverage orders. There are tv monitors if you really don't want to play golf too. Plushy couches to sit comfortably on for a party of 6.

It's not a one-stop, get all your groceries for the week kind of place, but it works marvelously as a neighborhood market with a few necessities and a great variety of delicious fruits, vegetables, olives, pasta and frozen meat.

Goddamn am I glad this place opened.  Prior to this, my closest convenient neighborhood market was Rollin's Market with its rotting bell peppers and frozen Banquet dinners.  There's always Fry's or Safeway, but I like hitting up a small little market on the corner of my neighborhood and build a rapport with the employees and owners as part of establishing a community.

The dude who runs the place will sometimes thrown in a tomato or apple or lime in with your bag of groceries.  Hey, free apple.  

Not everything they have is permanent.  Sometimes something new will be there, and the next week it will be gone, but in a way, I like that about it.  You go in there, and they have these Indian pickles made from wild cucumbers.  Next week, in its place, will be garlic pickles or something else awesome.

For what the place is, it's marvelous.  It's a little place and about as un-ghetto as it gets.

Pizzas were okay. Seem to take awhile for two little pizzas. The número UNO had hardly any meat on it. The shroom was good.

He did spill his milk. I asked for some extra napkins. Those came way later.

Each meal comes with a house salad, red and/or white House wine, garlic bread and a cappuccino.  The salad was so-so. It has a slice (like you would get at the deli counter) of salami in it with a hunk of processed mozzarella cheese and is slightly overdressed.   The wine was for sure cheap, but I wasn't expecting anything fancy considering it was included. The meal, depending on what you picked, doesn't take too long to get there but again, isn't anything to write home about.  It seemed like previously frozen, processed pasta- not homemade- with processed cheeses and canned sauce. I've had better at chains. The garlic bread wasn't fresh- seemed like it had been sitting a while and was hard. I tasted the cappuccino and it was ok but had a strong nutty flavor, almost like pecan. 

Again, the 2 stars are for the ambiance and the accordion player than came by our table to entertain.   It's Vegas- there are so many places with much better food for the same price.",2.0

So bad that I had to review as soon as I got out. Our waitress didn't greet us properly, did not ask if we needed any drinks, and didn't clear our plates. The host did that all. Despite the horrible service from her, I still proceeded to give her a tip as she stood with the machine. She didn't say thank you, and was so rude. There was another table next to us and she said thank you and have a great day to the other table- NOT US. She left without a word and grabbed the cash tip we gave her as if she was ungrateful that we were there. Whoever that server is today- we did not get her name, I hope she realizes how horrible she was today, and the fact that we are Asians and the people next to us were Canadians and got the service everyone deserved just shows how this can be a little if not wholly racist.

They at least should have something like chicken tenders, or nuggets. I had the bbq burger, order medium well. It came out over cooked and charcoaled. It was hard to eat, and I stopped after a few bites. Also most bbq burgers come with bbq sauce, this one did not. The fries are pretty good here though. I also had the chicken Alfredo pasta, it was pretty good. It had the right amount of sauce to pasta ratio, and the cheese on top was a nice touch.

There's a huge selection and everything we tried was really good. Even the pasta & pizza which are normally gross at buffets, was good quality & delicious. The sushi area is great compared to other buffets, the crab legs (cold, but both snow & king) were amazing! The mashed potatoes were incredibly yummy.

eKcuH_H1m2zO_jSQUEU9JA,"I've been looking for a new place to get a good gyro ever since I moved to the North Valley, and I finally found it! The Greek Pita is amazing all around. Here's a breakdown:

The Food: The gyros are to die for! They're piled so high with meat, onions and loads of sauce! Be sure to order your gyros with EVERYTHING. The fries that come with it are pretty tasty too!

The Service: The lady up front that takes your order is super cool and very sweet. The wait time for your food is pretty short. I went during a busy Sunday lunch (they were packed) and it was only about 5 minutes and I had my food. 

The Restaurant: It's really nice inside! Outside, it looks like an everyday Valley strip mall, but inside it's very nice and cozy. 

The Price: It's about the same here, as it is everywhere else you go to get Greek food. In comparison to Athens Gyros on Northern and 23rd Ave, it IS a little more expensive at Greek Pita. However, you get quite a bit more on your plate with Greek Pita. 

Overall, this place is a must visit if you're looking for a good Greek place in Happy Valley. I'm giving it four stars, only because it's the best in the North Valley, but I'm not quite convinced it's the best out of the entire Phoenix area.",4.0

LqVjn6TxzAp1cOQRnuRBew,"Part of what makes Yelp so exciting, at least for me, is finding places that I might not normally hear about. Rock 'N'oodles is definitely one of those good finds! I don't live or work anywhere near downtown and would have probably never seen it otherwise. It's a small building right off Charleston on 3rd Street that would be easy to miss if you were driving by. The restaurant itself is very small and can only seat about 12 people plus a couple outside tables. I love the décor though, it's simple but awesome with an entire wall covered in great albums they've got in really cool little frames.

When it comes to the food, you'll quickly realize why it's called Rock 'N'oodles. All the dishes are named after songs like Great Balls of Fire, Californication & The Devil Went Down To Georgia, just to name a few. Two of the ones we've tried so far now are Buffalo Soldier and Sweet Home Alabama...which I can only describe as versions of mac 'n cheese on steroids! The Alabama is a gouda macaroni topped with popcorn chicken and BBQ sauce with some bacon and onions tossed in. With the Buffalo Soldier you get blue cheese macaroni with carrots and celery topped with buffalo chicken. Now, like I said...steroids! Flavor is spectacular in both, pasta is cooked perfectly and each bite just keeps you wanting more! 

I've noticed some reviews mention small portions. I can only assume the owner/management are paying attention because these are definitely not small plates. We've also tried Born On The Bayou and Paradise City...I was only able to finish my entire plate once. On top of that, the customer service is great and even after my son accidentally spilled his Sprite all over the counter, we were met with smiles and a friendly attitude! Prices aren't bad either, with the most expensive dish coming in at about $12. This is a must try spot!",4.0

As soon as we entered we were being rushed to order as the kitchen was closing. No biggie. We ordered and set down and got our water. It was a waiting game from then on. Our waiter took 20 minutes to come to us after I got his attention for the drink menu. He brought one menu for 5 people. No worries we shared the menu then waited for another 15-20m to get someone's attention to take our drink order. Drinks came to the table at a reasonable time and were very good. I had the ""inception"" cocktail. It was delish. 

Food also came out at a reasonable time. 
Apps: chicken curry puffs $15- 10/10 curry filling was tasteful and good combination with puff pastry
Mr chow spare ribs $19- 5/10 not much flavor.
Beijing meat dumpling $15-7/10 it was a little bland but mr chow's house sauce fixed that. 

Finished our apps and No water refills. Had to get someone's attention for refills. No one checked on us if we wanted more drinks from the bar or anything either. 
Entrée: 
Steamed sea bass $45- 10/10 it's sea bass! The sauce on it was very good. 
Velvet chicken $36- 3/10 no taste at all! Had to add lots of special house sauce.
Lamb with spring onions $38- 3/10 again, no taste to it. All you can taste is the lamb and salt. House sauce helped. 
Beef with oyster sauce $42- 7/10. Oyster sauce added enough salt to make it this dish pleasant.

I've read through some of the other reviews and if they gave less than 5 stars they are not eating at the same restaurant as me. The prices are moderate, the food always tastes the same no matter who is cooking, good. The food is flavorful and I've ordered many different items on the menu and they are all delicious. The happy hour is amazing. Sundays during football season are a little crowded but that is to be expected, and it is not because it is full of ""homeless"" people like one of the reviews by Anthony stated. It is full of people drinking, eating, watching football and having an amazing time. If you have never tried Blue 32 it needs to be on your places to go.",5.0
Rvegt0xFmOlqe5bdyGLLkA,"1st time here. Nice space with lots of tables, counters and small patio with a view of the mountains. Ordering is quick and there are lots of choices. There was some confusion when I ordered the fennel sausage pizza because I opted for the red sauce instead of just olive oil. They started leaving off the ingredients from the fennel sausage pizza since I changed the sauce. I just wanted red sauce but still wanted everything that comes on the fennel sausage pizza. They even put the wrong cheese (fennel pizza is supposed to have ricotta not mozzarella). I guess I just need to be more clear, but it's my 1st time here. 

Dough was thin and crispy, but the ingredients were sparse and not as nicely art directed as a Blaze pizza or Pieology. Those places seem to put more care in the assembly of your custom pizza.

Alexis, the owner, is an excellent instructor and very knowledgeable  taking extra care to address my limitations. As I became more proficient and confident, I notice significant improvement in my strength and comfort level. With scoliosis, core strength  and agility are severely compromised. Pilates addresses just that as well as overall strengthing. As a RN, I was impressed at Alexis' ability to evaluate and adjust movements  to accomodate  my limitations and focus on my unique issues. I find that I now have waist again and have the strength to hold myself  more upright  giving the appearance of regaining some of my lost height.

Now saying they have a lot of pinball games would be a total understatement. They have every pinball game I could ever remember playing when I was a kid and then a ton more that were made before I was even born.

There was one game that was like air hockey but with pinball where you played against one of your friends and the board tilted back and forth. granted it was super slow, but it was a really cool interesting thing.

The room was spotless although it does get knocked a star because there wasn't enough room to store our clothes (no dresser) and the room was a bit small with popcorn ceilings still.  But it did have a ton of outlets and the bathroom stuff was nice- neutrogena (not spelled right I think) shampoo conditioner soap and even makeup remover wipes.

I was drawing a serious blank when the sis shouted, ""ORIGIONAL HAMBURGER WORKS!"" ARR?? *lil puppy ears raise up in a questioning manner*

She quickly drove us there and it was adjacent to Phoenix College and had a cool Encanto vibe... I dug it. It's right next to this paint ur own ceramic pottery place that seemed so cool! When we entered the works...

It is HUGE on the inside! there are crazy signs from the 40s and 50s and traffic lights and the coolest copper topped tables. I totally dug it's cavernous feel. Ahhh... and the smell!! of fresh cooking meat!! WHOO HOO!!

We had to go through a lil line that reminded me of Castles n Coasters and some of the older Taco Bells... hmmm not so cute. but I can see how it could be necessary... I can just imagine how busy this place gets at lunch time with the college just RIGHT over there! 

Their burgers sounded pretty average... terriyaki burger, bacon cheese burgers - there's no crazy toppings that don't make sense like some places... just straight up great burger classics. but WHAT is different about the way the menu looked was that they had a retirement burger?! WTF?? it comes with a boat and a car! sweet!! the perfect sides!! I bet burgers totally taste better on a boat!! Now if only I could get a $1,000,000 to find out if it's true!! But since I couldn't afford the retirement burger, I opted for a 1/2lb patty topped with bacon and cheese. The sis chose a side order of half zucchini & onion rings and the cuz threw it DOWN that night yo!! TWO half pound patties with cheese! I'm not cool enough to hang with that! :(

We went around the corner, through the labrynth and paid we told the chick our name and got our cups, the soda fountain area is so cool! I love the Iced Tea section, there were many options to choose from! Sweetened black tea and green tea, raspberry and unsweetened tea... lovesit! and my sister's happy to see Red Creme soda can be found there too! 

When the food was ready I walked up to the wagon 'o toppings and had FUN! I buried my burger with mounds of lettuce, mayo, ketchup and some tomatos and tons of pickles... and when i was all done... I could barely fit it in my mouth! But somehow i managed and it was soo yummy!! Freshy cooked over a fire, it was so great! I haven't had such a good burger in a long time!

my ONLY complaint is that I wasn't sure about the daily meal deals... I didn't see it until the last second! and that the sides are so SMALL!! HUGE ass burgers... lil baby sides! WTF?! and for almost as much as a burger?!?! NOT COOL!!

But seriously, the people are cool and so are the other diners, there were tons of yummy firemen when I we went! Also, the attached bar looks like an awesome place to get drunk in!! It's totally on the list of places to try out! I really enjoyed myself here and got crazy full off of my huge burger and baby side! I still can't believe the cuz could handle a large double burger!! Craziness!! I'll definately be back with more in tow!

To my yelpers: i say go!! and try the burgers and marvel at the round lil circles of bacon atop of a perfectly charred burger! Load up on the toppings (like I did) and try not to bitch about the small sides (like I did) and try each of different types of tea (like I did) and maybe even a beer or two and don't ask a fireman if you can see their hose...

So, driving by Gelato 64 for years because it is right next to Lee Lee's, I decided it would be in my best interests to try it out. If I didn't, my asian citizenship might have been taken away.

There are now only 2 places that come to my mind when I want gelato. Angel Sweets and Gelato 64. By far, these are the two best places for gelato. There isn't even a contest.

The strawberry cheesecake had an amazing texture that was somehow gelato and still had remnants of cheesecake. It was a perfectly well done recipe with the perfect amount of sweetness and just a hint of tartness from the strawberries.

Double fudge chocolate brownie was also mind bogglingly delicious. Again, the texture was perfected to give your mouth an explosion that would rival the creation of the universe. The brownie 'chunks' were sized perfectly and it made every small bite a pleasure to have.

1.  The Lentil Soup is as good as advertised.  Best I have EVER had.
2.  The waitress is indeed very cute, again repeating other Yelpers.
4.  The basmati rice was top-notch.
3.  The rest of the food was ""decent"" but far from ""awesome.""

Pita Jungle has better food at similar prices.  If you want this type of food, other than the lentil soup, it's decent but not a must-stop spot.  I might go back just for that lentil soup.  Still making my mouth water 16 hours later.

Went back, and the lentil soup was only ""Meh"" this time.  I had thought that maybe it would be 100% consistent with my past visit and all the other reviews.  Unfortunately, I must have caught them on a rare ""weak lentil soup"" day.  I ordered two bowls and a cup ($10.85) before knowing it would be less than awesome.  Too bad.

Why go there:
They have good selection, both for the carnivore and the vegetarian. Their selection of house made hummus and Greek fries are fun to order to share.
Portions are large, their tzatziki is great and good with pretty much anything in there. They have a good selection of bottled drinks like the half liter of Coke hencho en Mexico, always a winner with a good grilled meat and fries dish.

Downside:
Bummer the place doesn't have lamb as one of their main meats. I walked in craving a nice portion of lamb Souvlaki with a heaping portion of fresh tzatziki. (This is more of a hint for the owners if you're reading this!)

There's no parking in the front of the plaza where Gal's is, you will have to park in the main parking area or underground and walk around. The decor is a typical Japanese restaurant though I will say there are lots of tables and the restaurant is always lively. There are decently priced lunch and dinner combos and will come with Korean glass noodles, rice, soup and salad. 

The sashimi in my combo today was thinly sliced with little to no fish flavour.  Texture felt a bit odd so I ended up not eating  all of it. The sushi looked like it was falling apart.  The plates and soup bowls are lined red interior and the ink/paint is peeling off badly. Not only does this make it look dated, I also feel like the paint might go into my food.

The flavour every dish has ...is not just pretty ... flavours are there too.!!
The friendly service .. the whole team at DS is very attentive and friendly.!!
What you get for what you paid ... on all the restaurants i have done so far DS is the best Value vs quality 65$ is a bargain ..!!  And add 30$ for a wine pairing ..!!! 
The menu they offer is worth way more than the 65$ they ask for .!!
The restaurant it self ... is beautiful very intimate with an open kitchen ( they will be closing the kitchen with glass soon .. so the chef can have kore privacy ) the lamps are made by a local artist ..wooden chairs wooden tables ... and every table has a granite brick with the name of the person who placed the reservation ( very original touch ).
They change their menu every 6 to 7 weeks .... to make you ( like me ) go back and try every single menu.!!!
For all those reasons and more .... this place deserves nothing less than 5",5.0

I couldn't tell you what it was but it was not very pleasant.  So, the fish was actually decent on its own, but they put some very old and hard to chew meat under it that was absolutely nasty.

planning a trip and could not take him we had to find a place he and my husband would be ok with.

First order a beer and asked for with a cold mug and orange. Received bottle of beer only until 5 min later when the server Kristen came and asked if we wanted to order yet. We put in for the sampler appetizer with no ranch only  blue cheese. It came out with only ranch and as we looked at it 2 of the the rattlesnake bites had been overcooked and all the filling came out. So we waited and waited and waited 15 minutes before Kristen came back to check on us and we told her about the issues with the snakebites she said Oh well, but she did endup bringing us our bluecheese. So now we are waiting for our main dishes with hopes of better service. As for right now Texas Roadhouse service or I should say server is truly lacking.

DrftCOvq0Inf6fxUuuw55A,"Fox Sports Grill a year ago would have gotten 4-5 stars.    The service was terrific, the food was above-par for a typical bar, the prices were fairly reasonable although a tad bit upscale and there was a vast amount of seating that would allow you to watch virtually any game in comfort.

Now other than the seating, pretty much everything else has changed.   The last two times I've been here the service was lousy, downright apathetic, there seemed to be no shortage of servers and wait-staff in the place but they seemingly vanished at times without a trace.    


Now the worst part.     The menu was overhauled almost entirely.  Previously it was filled with good stuff, at reasonable prices.    What they've managed to do at Fox Sports Grill in terms of an amazingly epic  transformation is to completely destroy the menu, drop the quality of the food tremendously and yet somehow RAISE the prices.

Now you're stuck with overpriced, dry and unappetizing sliders, food that tastes of dirty oil and more.       Their pizzas in the past were fantastic, the crap they're serving up nowadays reminds me more of generic frozen-food aisle grocery store pizza(not even Digiorno).     So the food tastes awful, but they've had the audacity to raises the prices.

Now you're sitting there, paying way above-par prices for sub-par food.   WTF man?      This place used to be fantastic but evidently some genius decided that they could make more profit by offering crappier quality at higher prices.      I'm not buying it.      There's too much competition, too many other options for this sort of nonsense.         

  I can head to Zipps down the road, The Arena(yeah, its standard bar food but it won't cost an arm and leg) or best of all, Casey Jones Grill where I can pay less and somehow get much better food and service.


Bottomline, this place has jumped the shark completely.    Whatever they had going right for them is pretty much gone.     Its a shame, because this used to be a fave of mine but after what I've witnessed there, its not worth spending money or time at anymore.",1.0

fQCm68xM1bEH2zL71_wCXQ,"My wife brought her 2005 Mustang to 911 Collision (or Caliber Collision as they also call themselves - why two names?).

Our primary concern was her rear bumper that was damaged while parked in a parking lot.  The other driver was not courteous enough to leave a note.  Our secondary concern was damage to the hood (also while unattended in a parking lot but some time earlier).

911 Collision did a reasonable job on the bumper - covered under insurance after our $500 deductible was met.  The color doesn't exactly match but then it doesn't scream out either.  One of the people that works there told me that you can never get the color to match because the bumper is plastic and the body is sheet metal.  I'll go on record now by calling that out as complete hogwash - Detroit, Germany, and Japan do it all day long.  The color might be hard to match for a host of other plausible and legitimate reasons but not because one is metal and the other is plastic.

So we have established that, at best, the work is mediocre and they like to lie about it.  Now on to the hood.

The hood was originally quoted as a $1000 correction because they would have to paint the WHOLE FRONT COWL - hood, fenders, grill, bumper, etc.  All for two ding's no larger than a plug nickel.  And $1000 is the REDUCED price because we already had the car in their shop.  Normally it would have been more.

We decided that was too much and went with Option-B: they pop the dents, wet sand the area and then blend in a little touch up paint, wet sand again to smooth it out, clear the area and wet sand again.  All for $300.  Not bad - right?  Wrong.

It looks like all they did was pop the dents.  Is still isn't smooth, The scratches are very obvious, and I cant tell that it was wet sanded at all.  I think they just let the shop lackey have a crack at it with the touch up paint you get at Auto Zone.  Had I known that this is what $300 gets me, I would have passed.  It looks Rookie all the way.  See pics I've uploaded to this vendor - they are of a red hood with the still visible scratches in them AFTER the work was completed.

I waited around to discuss it with the shop manager but he was busy and couldn't get around to me.  Eventually I left.  He did call me and offer to ""make it right"" but that didn't involve a discount on the work done and he wanted it back with more money to do more work.  After what had been done already I didn't trust them with any more time or money.  

Score is as follows...
Quality of the bumper = Three stars
Quality of the hood = Subtract one star - Now two.
Lies told by employee = Subtract one star - Now only one star.
We could keep subtracting but whats the point?

WT3t86I5nMgS4xqAVYobtQ,"I came to Solstice a long time ago for a Yelp event.  The desserts blew my socks off!  I had wanted to return since but I needed an excuse (I live in Markham; Solstice is located in Mississauga).  So happily, my boyfriend had his birthday, and I got to pick where to wine and dine him.  And I picked Solstice.

A step up from many places, the classy services greeted us before the pleasant venue.  The greeter was prompt, courteous and effective.  A waiter promptly asked if we wanted water or other beverages.  Then came the daily specials recommendation, the order taking and so on.  Throughout the meal, the services was smooth, polite and professional.  By the end of the meal, our waiter built rapport with us and laughed at jokes with us.  I would say our waiter was a gem.

We ordered an antipasto appetizer, a rib eye steak with crushed blue cheese and a seafood crepe, a sundae dessert and 2 alcoholic beverages.  The antipasto was good, leaving a clean, crispy feel in my mouth.  The steak was big and extremely tender yet a tad salty to my liking.  It went down easy.  The seafood crepe was creamy, and it was loaded with small shrimps and scallops bits.  True to experience, the sundae was a knockout.  It was big, sweet, loaded with fudge and whipped cream.  The glass was an ice cream cone lookalike.  So cute.  

I have mentioned that the venue is pleasant.  The interior decoration is romantic and upscale casual.  The section where we sat allows privacy.  The noise level is low.  There is another section that is larger and more open, so big groups will find themselves more comfortable there. The overall package makes this restaurant a good choice for special occasions.",5.0

nrGSoSqfHWAgjklWKidRVw,"Flavors the Buffet used to be great!  On Christmas Eve we went there during our visit to Las Vegas.  We paid extra for a ""special"" buffet.  We waited about 40 minutes in line, and when we got in it was 9pm.  They close at 10pm.  They started taking the food off the buffet floor at about 9:35pm.  

But, this did not really matter as the food tasted like left-overs.  The food was stale, cold when supposed to be hot, and / or over-cooked.  We tried to complain to the manager.  She basically said ""too bad"".  When she tried to give us a free buffet ticket, I refused stating it was a conflict of interest.  She go upset about that and stormed off!  

The place, like Harrah's in general, has really gone down-hill over the years.  I went to Palace Station and ate their buffet (which you would expect to be mediocre...and it is) but even the Palace Station buffet was better than Flavors.  Skip this buffet!

If you bought the 24-hour pass, go to Planet Hollywood (good but has gone down as well) or Paris.  Rio is always good.  Or, just save your money, go one block East from the Strip and go to Ellis Island Casino on Koval Lane and get a New York steak dinner and a great beer for $9.

I went here asked for balyage and later I got orange hair with spots. paid a ton of money and decided to wait till my next apt with another stylist to get it fixed. She said she would fix it and during the process used the wrong toner and it turned my hair one color. She then had to ask another stylist how to fix it after she apologized and they decided to strip it out!!! I was so upset because it is not good for your hair.
Then she had to use another toner and 4 hours later my hair was the exact same as I came in. I talked to the salon manager and she was very rude and said I still had to pay for everything. This place is outrageous and they don't care about your hair at all they just try to get a ton of people in and charge you outrageous prices. I went home crying and called back to see if I can come in another day to get it fixed and they told me I had pay for the products to get it fixed after I paid so much in the first place.

h17ep5S7O8_JMKovooWoVA,"The food from this place reminds me of home. I'm mostly Taiwanese, a little island off of China, but the food here has the taste of Hong Kong with a few American favorites for the locals such as the classic mongolian beef or the citrus-y orange chicken. 

I personally go for a mix of both. When I'm feeling more cultural, I'll grab some lobster with garlic, or even some chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (warning, expect this dish to be bitter, that is a valued taste in most Chinese cuisines).

Today, I grabbed some take out of the mongolian beef for myself with fried rice and egg roll, and the girlfriend at home got the chicken lo mein with fried rice and egg roll.

Dude, just the egg roll alone and a few bites out of the entreé and you are FULL. Seriously, their portions are huge. 

Expect leftovers and merry moments later in the day to finish your food.

Caveat: Don't expect the service to be very kind. When going to truly authentic Chinese places, do not expect the customer service standards of that of even a TGIF. The Chinese are very ""to the point"" when it comes to food. You go in, sit down, say hello, order some food, pay your bill, get out. Don't make chit chat.",5.0

Two years ago we bought our last car, a Mustang, in Tempe (hint at a place where they predominantly sell Swedish cars) - We loved the car but hated the experience. We traded that car and bought a Ford Expedition at All Auto's Direct and really had a fantastic experience. We so appreciated the transparent, non-pushy approach from the three guys we dealt with during the process, but where they really stood out was the service we received afterwards. The car actually had a few issues, but they immediately assumed responsibility and went above and beyond to resolve them.

I was just trying to spend more money with adding on the Linebacker sectional to my purchase ?

So I had to drive to Ashleys to place the order and I asked to speak to the Manager Julian Block that I met the prior purchase and he made everything right and then handed me off to Sales rep Danielle Lengyel  who worked flawlessly on my purchase and even gave me a Jolly Rancher .

They also gave me knowledgeable tips on how to inspect the furniture when it was delivered so all went smoothly on my delivery day and I couldnt be happier for now and I hope the pieces hold there quality for many years to come but I also got the 5 year coverage free .

So enclosing if you have ANY issues at all ask for Julian Block the Store Manager because he truly cares and and will make things right if at all possible and he just doesnt blow smoke as he treats you like a valued customer for life and not just a one and done purchase and I will recommend Ashley to all my friends for his quality service alone .

We walked in and it looked like they just opened, fairly empty, about 4 tables. It took about 5 minutes till we were acknowledged. They sat us at a pretty small table for the amount of people, but I don't like to complain before I get my food because I to worked in the food service industry and assumed it was for a reason. We told them a few more people were coming and and we needed an extra chair, they said they would get it when they arrived, they didn't. I grabbed the chair and the settings. Bread and drinks were not brought out unless asked for and even then we had to remind them. 
So from the time we got there till we left was about 2 hours 10 minutes so you can guess how long we waited for each thing to occur throughout.",2.0

This creperie is at the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  Took uber to get here because we were just seriously craving for some good crepe!  We were so excited to finally have crepes.

Thank goodness there was no line, but we encountered a very unhappy guy, that was the manager at the time ... yikes!  I mean, no customer service skills at all.  No, Smiles, No, Hello, we asked about the different crepes and he told us to read the menu... uhmm really!? Idk, maybe he is having a bad day.. who knows!  I hope he will learn how to smile more next time.

Went for lunch with a friend. We had a beer (decent selection - could use a little bit more choices considering the number of local microbreweries that are accessible in quebec) and I had the turkey burger while my friend had the King Kong grilled cheese. My burger was very tasty, a bit on the ""too big"" side but still manageable. The grilled cheese on the other hand fell into the ""humongous"" section - not easy to eat to start with due to the size of it (what good is combining these items if you still have to split them apart to actually eat them) and the size of the patties are simply too big. Food was tasty - nothing to complain about there.

Basically - the size is just too big, which leads in wasted food and money. The menu could use a little bit more selection on some items (more salads as main meals, or even as a side choice (if it is available, it wasn't offered to us)) and the burgers should be offered in two sizes of patties.",3.0

The curry here is surprisingly aromatic. I would not liken this to Chinese curry. It smells more like a Malaysian or Indian curry? It's spicy, in a leaves-your-tongue-tingly-after-eating kinda way.

He then tells me i need left caliber replaced, rotors replaced, clean and adjust on back, and brake system flush. Red flag if my brakes haven't been changed in a year why would I only need a clean and adjustment on the back? Mmmmhhhhh when i told him to put it back together he offered to take 50$ off.

1.  I asked for gluten free crust.
2. They delivered my pizza to me at my table.  I took a bite and immediately knew the texture was wrong.

HOWEVER, they handled it PERFECTLY!

First, they made sure I wasn't in imminent danger.  I'm not ALLERGIC, I'm intolerant...my stomach feels sick later, but I can still breathe and don't need an ER.  So, they did the right thing there.

Then, waiter accepted FULL responsibility.  They remade my pizza and they remade a fresh dish for my friend as well so that she didn't have to choose between eating without me or waiting and letting her dish get cold.  Good move!

Waiter was absolutely amazingly friendly and made our happy hour beverages himself (he used to be a bartender...my Mai Tai was DELICIOUS!)

They remade my pizza, with a gluten free crust, and they didn't charge me for it without me asking for them to take it off!

Basically, they messed up, but they made up for it in a big way, and I'm sure they learned a valuable lesson. I'm glad this happened to me and not someone who is deathly allergic to wheat, because that would've been a horrible experience for everyone involved.

o7CJKVaN6NJDk3Muc16ZXw,"If Sunday brunch was a religion, I would highly consider converting into it. Conversion to Sunday brunch would require you to accept the fact that you don't need to wake up early on Sunday, and therefore you can allow yourself to eat something that is heavier than just breakfast. Brunch brings to the table a few things that are worthy of worship such as eggs benedict, bagel & lox, and huevos rancheros. I love the concept as we usually have brunch with our friends, family, or loved ones; hence, brunch builds a sense of community. Jokes apart, going for brunch is one of the highest trends in the Toronto restaurant industry. In the past few months a few fine dining restaurants have added a brunch menu. I have a few favourites in the city but today I will focus on The Saint Tavern.

The Saint Tavern is located on Ossington St. near Queen St. West. We were a group of four and we arrived at the restaurant around 1:30PM. It was busy but we were lucky enough to get a very comfy table. The decor was modern and charming. Polished cement floors, old looking light fixtures, all black, white, and gray with a very-large-bar.

We started with the deviled eggs with chives, radish salad, and bacon. It was delicious and we were all fighting to get the last piece. I opted for having their grilled cheese sandwich with roasted tomatoes and salad. It was simple but perfect. The strong cheese was balanced by the tomatoes- so yummy! My friends loved their choices and we were all pleased with our waitress. I recall drinking copious amounts of coffee on that day and not eating ANYTHING ELSE after having that meal.

Znd4EbTDgh3K4whftBjOVQ,"Wait? What the heck is wrong with me?! I've been coming here since I moved to Vegas because this is my parents go to spot for local food and uncle Russell is AWESOME! When my baby was a baby he'd hold her and play with her so I could eat, even when it was busy. Now that she's 4, he just spoils her with goodies. Everytime we come in we always get a warm ""eh how you aunty and uncle"". Yes he's referring to my parents and that's the local kine hospitality I miss from the islands. They have local favorites like hamburger steak, fried noodles, teri hamburger, oxtail soup and they also have a much bigger korean menu! My dad always gets the Bulgogi and my family from the islands always ask for his Saba. All his dishes are ono and he makes you feel like ohana when you go in.",5.0

PTLuxroAL-HQ_JU8pnWhGw,My friend and I went to this place for dinner one night.  DELICIOUS lamb curry and garlic naan.  It is hard to find a good Indian restaurant - and the last place that I would expect one to be is inside a Vegas hotel.  If you're a fan of the cuisine I would encourage you to check this place out.,4.0
3aympxY5vuWDyqY8NGGrtQ,"We've eaten years 3 times: the first shortly after opening was great, then not-so-good last fall, and recently last week. Our latest visit was EXCELLENT!!!.  We ate at Delmonico and Gordon Ramsey last week and both were lacking compared to Beso.  

Our steaks at Beso were the tenderest and best flavored by far.  The service and ambiance were outstanding! 

Thanks again Beso!",5.0

No matter the brand, most shirts were priced $15 or under!  2) You watch for promotional sales. Last weekend everything at Kate Spade was 70% off! 3) You go during the middle of the week when there are less customers.",5.0

The addition is real...

...the more the better right?! Isn't that the saying?

I'm such a sucker for anything that is special to a location. So, of course they have Vegas only bracelets. I had to get one, but for a friend, since she loves Vegas. I contemplated it for myself, but decided against it.

Lucky for me, they had a sale going. Buy 3 get one free. It's really the perfect storm, two for me and two to give as gifts.

The sales girls were really sweet and laid back, not even a hint of being pushy or over selling their product. I enjoyed my experience at this store. They kept it low key and classy, not Vegas style and overbearing!

The arm candy addition is real...",5.0
PQ2s4V36GO9gTqky9ndAfg,"When you spend six dollars on a hotdog, I think it better be damn good, or at least damn drunk. Neither of these were the case at this ridiculous place.
Don't waste your time or money.

I had some form of chili that tasted just a minute away from being thrown away. Stale cheese was on top (they didn't even bother melting it to cover it up).
The bun was just as stale.
The bartender was a rude hipster.
I felt really silly for paying for this.
I guess it's my fault.",1.0
fQDmcCKVX8rBK4ev6Q3QrA,I was excited to have a ramen place closer to home.  I looked up the menu before going and when I got there some of things they didn't have. The portions were small and there wasn't much variety in broth or topping choices.  The fried chicken appetizer was the only decent there. Maybe I am used to other ramen places but even the broth wasn't very tasty.,1.0
R9SkOjO68gwkbqKrSh6luA,Went for breakfast! Food was horrible! Service was equally as bad! If you want dry mashed potatoes this is your place! I asked for some gravy or something to make the potatoes edible and the waitress looked at me like I was an idiot and then charged me $4 for gravy! Not to mention the guy that grabs you and takes your picture at the door and then interrupts your meal to try and sell you a copy for $20!,1.0
E_Y7pKaFz56F5pliYvMAxQ,"Oh crap, I should have finished writing my review for Harvey's immediately after dining there, because now, for the life of me, I can't remember what I had for dinner.   That alone may speak volumes about my experience; but what I can piece together from my poor memory was that the evening was in total, immemorable.   Food, service, atmosphere all mediocre.

Not the type of place I'd choose to eat a full blown meal at again, but perhaps grab a beer, some wings and watch a few games.",2.0
