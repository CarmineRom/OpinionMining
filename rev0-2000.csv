Q1sbwvVQXV2734tPgoKj4Q,Total bill for this horrible service? Over $8Gs. These crooks actually had the nerve to charge us $69 for 3 pills. I checked online the pills can be had for 19 cents EACH! Avoid Hospital ERs at all costs.,1.0
8e9HxxLjjqc9ez5ezzN7iQ,"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality

Many of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.

The service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.

It's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options.",1.0
yi0R0Ugj_xUx_Nek0-_Qig,"Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf. I know I'm going on about the salad ... But it was perfect.

Drink prices were pretty good.

The Server, Dawn, was friendly and accommodating. Very happy with her.

In summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!",5.0

qrffudO73zsslZbe8B9D3Q,"I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The ""Man O'War"" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. 
The only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  
Nonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are! 
The reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! 
The servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! 
After another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. 
This is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving. 
The toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.",2.0
kbtscdyz6lvrtGjD1quQTg,"Like walking back in time, every Saturday morning my sister and I was in a bowling league and after we were done, we'd spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up.

My sister was daring and play the machines hard, she was afraid of that ""tilt"" showing up and freezing the game.  I, on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure I got my quarter's worth.

This place has rows and rows of machines, some are really old and some are more of a mid 80's theme.  There is even a Ms pac man!  It was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years.",4.0

Z7wgXp98wYB57QdRY3HQ3w,"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. 
I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. 
Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews.

JVcjMhlavKKn3UIt9p9OXA,"I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out.",1.0

GJXCdrto3ASJOqKeVWPi6Q,"I *adore* Travis at the Hard Rock's new Kelly Cardenas Salon!  I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  

Travis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! 

Next Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! 

Travis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!",5.0
11a8sVPMUFtaC7_ABRkmtw,"Today was my second out of three sessions I had paid for. Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, ""well burns come with teeth whitening."" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn't stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won't be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior, who claims to be in the business for ""10 years."" Admit your wrongs, but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly.",1.0

fdiNeiN_hoCxCMy2wTRW9g,"I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, "" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?"" She does. 

My hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard ""mmmm this is so good"" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.

So-

Do order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. 

If they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. 

Do make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it's available.",4.0

G7XHMxG0bx9oBJNECG4IFg,"Tracy dessert had a big name in Hong Kong and the one in First Markham place has been here for many years now! 

Came in for some Chinese dessert, and I must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years. I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!

A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side. 

I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it! 

I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished.",3.0

Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year. Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies. The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women. 
The biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.  It's definitely a comfort food. The best part is that they ship internationally. Yes, they are that good.",5.0
6BnQwlxRn7ZuWdzninM9sQ,"I love chinese food and I love mexican food. What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a ""rice bowl"" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.

I'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a ""C"" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room. 

Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me. 

The jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty. 

They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special. 

Not gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times. I don't recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day.",3.0

Second time we came on a wednesday. We didn't know it was BBQ night, where they have a completely different menu, and don't offer anything from their original vegetarian-friendly menu. This menu has one vegetarian-friendly option - an eggplant sandwich. The vegetarian in my party said it was awful. Also, on BBQ night you choose 2 sides. Except they were out of all their sides except 2 - fries and potato salad. I can't say I was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main.

W1wbNaUnbMy4b9QqY3_SAg,"Unfortunately, I must recommend not to conduct any business with Fast Fix Jewelry and Watch Repairs.  The staff is completely unprofessional and I have never been treated so rudely in my life.  I was actually shocked and walked away thinking ""wow, how do those people even have a job?""

I have never written a negative review before, I usually chalk it up to someone having a bad day.  I have worked in customer service for 10+ years and I know it is exhausting and bad days happen.  But this is a special occasion.

I drove 30 minutes to try to find someone who could help me repair a watch band.  I was barely greeted upon arrival and right away felt like I was bothering them.  The girl behind the counter obviously just wanted me to leave, the blond kid working snapped at me when I asked a question and when I re-asked in order to clarify what he said he snapped again and said, ""I already told you?!?""  ""Is this even authentic?""  Shouting at me over his shoulder as he work on something else.

DAC4zWY2ZMa1vxpN9RrDvA,"This review is in regards to our experience watching SuperBowl 51 February 5, 2017 at the WestGate in the theater/auditorium.

Watch the game somewhere else.....

To those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.

So at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....

We were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow.
That's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.

So we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.

In summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will.",1.0

bjD0Dqn3k-fi00BXatrytg,"I tried this place because my girls are away for a month, and I REALLY wanted to try to wait until they came back, because NOBODY can hold a candle to them, but my toes were desperate.  When I went in, they were almost twice what I usually pay to begin with.  Then, before starting the pedicure, I specifically told them I already had gel polish on my toes.  They didn't tell me right then and there ""that will be an extra $5'.  No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn't even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1/2 grown.  Again, they didn't tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.  

The added stone 'massage' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that!

8swMTt9IXycp15r3WlCEmg,"One day after I satisfy my frozen yogurt craving at Kiwispoon... I get invited out to eat frozen yogurt at Piccadilly.  A rare opportunity to truly compare the two yogurt places.

Here, I tried three flavors - chocolate, pumpkin, and caramel sea salt.  Added toppings of brownie bits, chocolate caramel turtles, and mochi.

Overall, I liked the yogurt better at Kiwispoon. The frozen yogurt seems less rich in Piccadilly's and the flavors are not as strong.  The price per ounce is also marginally higher at Piccadilly's.

There are definitely pluses to Piccadilly's yogurt though.  I liked the toppings better - I thought the mochi tasted better, the brownie pieces were bigger, and the chocolate caramel turtles went great on ice cream.  The chocolate caramel turtles should be a standard topping for both frozen yogurt and ice cream places.

u1jQX0KfnG3AHty4ifEpFA,"notes: 1 visit, breakfast/lunch
overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.",4.0

After trying to get her attention a few times when she walked by we decided to just order off the bartender. We received the starters and the mains at the same time. The wings, brisket, and mac and cheese were alright at best. At this point we hadn't seen the server since she brought the food, so we had to go to the bar for more napkins and refills on the Cokes.

vBRxlgkpDTXjWiYBp1V6GA,They keep there appointments on time and are pretty efficient. However I am very disappointed in how they think that just because I am a girl that I do not know what is going on with my car's tires. The guy that helped me out told me that my two front tires tread was extremely low and that I would be needing two new tires in a month or two. He told me that he could show me the same tires I have on there now and how much they would be. When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price. So when I bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that. I honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280.,1.0

SERVICE: Extremely Poor

While I enjoyed the company of my friends, I would not come back to this restaurant, primarily because of the poor service. Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders. 

MAIN: Caprese Salad

The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).

MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it)

Our waitress was really nice and got the manger to switch out our dishes. My freind got the hamburger and I got the shrimp scampi. Her hamburger was better then the lasagna but was still lacking flavor. My scampi was better then the chicken but was also still under seasoned and the noodles were a bit under cooked.

Very large space, open layout.  Been here a few times years ago. I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib. 

They provide a self serve drink area, which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation. 

Unlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games.

Saae_VVf_v0fyNmB6Dc4kw,"I've never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be ""picky"" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.",1.0

I always like to chose a signature burger so I opted for the Spicy Cajun Burger and combo'd it up with there Beer Battered Rings and a Jones Strawberry-Lime  Soda.

Its a small location with an even smaller patio ( maybe 8 bar stools on a cramped balcony) that looks onto Charles Street. But definitely sit outside if you can grab a seat. Luckily the patio was vacant that late afternoon.

Toppings - They Spicy Cajun Burger - Avocado, jalapeños, lettuce,
Jalapeño havarti, tomatoes, Cajun spice & Smokey chipotle & honey mayo. There was ample toppings on the burger, I enjoyed the avocado on my burger, overall not too spicy but good kick from the sliced jalapeños.

Meat - Grilled perfectly, tasted average, but I found it too small compared to the bun.

Bun - Very soft, tasted good, but didn't hold up against the burger and all the toppings and at the end I was left with lots of bun and no more burger.

Beer Battered Onion Rings - Very thick batter on these rings, golden brown, crunchy, very filling.

Drink -Jones Strawberry-Lime Soda - Yummy not sour but good balance,

UoFxqWXBluvS4Q32spb8Lg,"Another solid BBQ place in Calgary. This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. 

I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.

Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.

The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) 

I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. 

The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead.

UIvFkXLBxWxM6aekvaCp8Q,"Took my kids here to hang out on one fine 72 degree sunny Saturday in February. Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.

Too bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. 

The playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! 

After a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the ""nice stuff"" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, ""Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?"" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.

After carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff.

I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!",5.0
VukV341GHtm9kcvoKR-5vQ,"Came here for the ""midnight"" launch of the PSVR. After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren't pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. 

The previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.

Not only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location).

My favorites are the Chicken Scarpariello, the pizza and the Sangria. My wife can't decide between four dishes. Our daughter loves the Penne ala Vodka, Lasagna, or Ravioli.

Mario and his sons work hard to please and we've never had a bad meal here. I've seen them bend over backwards to try and take care of obvious jerks. 

Plus to top it off, when local school invited local pizza places to present to a class on making pizza and recycling issues, Mario came and talked to the kids as if they were adults. All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons.

We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!",4.0

l7KB334CXThAcmZPOvF1zw,"Normally, I give a restaurant at least 3 stars as long as it has good food. However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.

First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommodate the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommodate the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.

I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous. 

To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.",2.0

Between Chip and Sylvia, I was ""sold"" on that apartment and we got the ""paperwork"" going. I enjoyed my stay there which lasted 6 months (3 months more that I initially signed up for).
When it came time to give my notice, Sylvia gave me all the details I needed, and these were pretty much the same that were in our initial Lease Agreement. They were kind enough to give me ample notice to show the apartment during my last 30 days, without too much inconvenience. Sylvia helped me tie up a few loose ends and even arranged to pick up a lamp for me that needed to be repaired when I moved out.
 
I would certainly reach out to the team at Sold on Charlotte again.

miAbIuIln8YfLoo6rf3MyQ,"Visited this restaurant after a 3 hour drive to get to it.  We, my boyfriend and I,  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.  

So we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how ""hot"" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable ""romantic"" evening of my life...

Now to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a ""salad"", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.


The soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.

The appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!

The salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.

The meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.

The dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?

The wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...

The atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.

We finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple! 

Upon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.

Would I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.

SZrbK4K4YaiDMfkUuYGiNQ,"I've tried to shop at Montblanc Toronto several times but the selection is very limited and the sales staff while attentive, not very friendly. Recently I tried to replace a ring I received as a gift and lost.  The Toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me, I asked them if they could check other locations with no avail.  

Because the ring had a lot of sentimental value I decided to call the  Hong Kong location where the ring was purchased. Over the phone the clerk, Jane, and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide.  She called me the next day from Hong Kong to inform me she found the last ring in London and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until I return to Hong Kong in a few months.  Not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost, I paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier.  The ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again :)...  This is the type of service that builds loyalty.  

The Montblanc store in Hong Kong is located in Pacific Mall. Jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on Kowloon Side on Canton Road. I'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me.  I will be forever be loyal to the Hong Kong location. Thanks Jane!  I'm giving 2 stars to the Toronto location, the Hong Kong location would easily have 5 stars.",2.0
oMKVNZp6C8866Lz_8HMoyg,"I LOVE this place! I have found the staff to be extremely knowledgable, beyond helpful and always willing to go above and beyond to do whatever they can to assist you. This store carries products that I can't find anywhere else besides online. They are great about returns if you have a finicky eater (like mine). 
I also love that they have no agenda when it comes to helping you select a certain food. They listen to what you're looking for and then make suggestions based on the info you've given them. They're also well versed in the latest pet food recalls (which are hard to stay on top of these days!)
If you sign up online, they offer discounts and specials all the time which helps with some of the pricier food. Organized, clean, and a huge selection. I have absolutely no complaints about this place... Except maybe that when they hold weekend pet adoptions I get depressed that I can't take all the animals home.",5.0

She was unapologetic and offered me a next day appointment, like she was doing me a favor since I ""MISSED"" my appointment.

Coming from someone raised in Latin America, I'm usually skeptical of restaurants that claim to have Latin American food because although the dishes try to imitate Latin American styles, they usually come up short and completely miss the subtle flavors that make these dishes what they're supposed to be. However, Chica completely nailed it. The whole chicken with chimichurri is a must-have (we shared it among four people) and the small dishes were delicious as well. The mini arepas that came with the guacamole were a really nice surprise and the empanadas were simply amazing and tasted just like the ones back home.

niN5qW_M5Y0W0zQEcQcFig,"My family and I came in on Wed. Night for dinner we had a party of 6 plus a baby(using a high chair). We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated and when we got to our table it was against the wall, half booth half chairs. My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said ""No"" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced.
The worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in.

nx3RLktQxXT6ACp5M3OJwA,"Fresh food, tasty, and amazing service are the 3 characteristics that come to my mind when thinking about this place. However price is a big downside.
Went there on a Tuesday night, did not have to wait for a table and service was quick and the staff was very friendly. The menu options are pretty limited but definitely focused on providing the most typical Portuguese experience. 
One major downside: the food portions are extremely small for the price you pay. The value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style. In a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there. 
2 mini starters, 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full. The desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream, probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for. Otherwise it was too pricy.

Our family enjoys a good cut that's perfectly done to each person's speculations. Also the service was perfect. Our server was thoughtful and attentive, without overly interrupting when we didn't need anything. However, for the high price of everything (not just the steaks) on the menu, we would've expected the place to feel more exclusive, more fancy, not so loud. It felt like a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment. We had to shout over the noise and the place wasn't even totally full (Sunday evening). The plates were also nothing special to look at. Again because of the price, we expected a few frills. The meat and separate sides came out just plainly put onto plates. No effort was put into the presentation. Even casual restaurants throw some greens or garnishes on the dish for a little extra aesthetic. Probably won't return. If I'm paying this much, I'd like to feel a little more pampered.",3.0

They called me like 4 days before the order was to be delivered to confirm the appointment. I advised the lady that no one was living in my father's apartment yet but if they could call me as they are on their way I could rush down to the place and open the door for them. I mean I live in the same complex so it wouldn't be a long wait! She said she would let the guys know but no promise...okaaaaay? I paid $1,200 for furniture, I am a repeat customer, and you can't make one quick easy courtesy call? Well I missed their delivery and no call was made. I found out from my LANDLORD that they came because they went to the office and he was going to let them in but they said no because someone had to sign the paper. To top it off, when I got my dad's key to check the place out before he arrived, there was a note on the COUNTER that said ""Sorry we Missed you""....so they entered the apartment and left the note but couldn't put the damn furniture together?? They denied going in but how the hell did the paper get on the counter? Anyway my dad arrived with NO furniture and we had to pay $50.00 for them to deliver the furniture again 3 DAYS LATER. My father has bad arthritis and basically no cartilage in his knees making it very hard for him to get up from low areas such as couches and FLOORS which he almost had to sleep on if it weren't for my friend who let us borrow her air mattress luckily.

BRNHu0kBhbiTMXhbERNw6A,"A toned down version of the king street location, GotStyle is a great store primarily for the service you receive.

It's definitely not for everyone - there is a price tag attached. But if you shop at places like Holt Renfrew or even the Bay then this place is considerably better in my opinion.  The reason - the sales agents are just better. They have pretty good sales twice a year, which is when I tend to go but sizing is obviously an issue at those times. I appreciate that they carry various price points in the mid to high range.  

Overall, I wouldn't get my formal wear from here. That's just me personally. I'd rather go to the U.S. and pay half the price for the same quality. But if you can't do that, they have an excellent selection and great tailors. You can find cheaper tailors in Toronto, but at least at GotStyle you don't have to go through the hassle of finding the right tailer. You can trust the store. 

They have an excellent selection of casual clothing and interesting and cool clothing pieces too.

We had a reservation for 9pm Saturday. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet but the host asked if we wanted drinks and took our drink orders. There is no drink menu here - the staff is the drink menu- which was nice. Everyone is very knowledgeable and quick with recommendations.

Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.

The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.

For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.

Earlier today my friend and I dropped in to grab some lunch.. the staff either all lost their dogs this morning, or just have the absolute worst attitudes you've ever seen in human beings. Not only was the nasty woman who served me avoiding any type of pleasantry but she was yelling across two other workers and a line of patrons asking what I wanted from the other end of the shop. When I asked the server for lettuce, onion and roasted red peppers on my sandwich she quite literally moaned very loud and followed it with yelling ""ughhhhh god help me!"" Before adding my toppings to my turkey sandwich. When one of the other servers asked us if our food was for ""here or to go"" the original server says aloudly ""to-go hopefully!!!"" Wtf... I'd love to know who this terrible human being thinks she is! I found my jaw on the floor more than once, wondered why she thought I was such a headache, and my friend and I decided right there that we would NEVER return nor would we let this review go untold to everyone we know!! I feel the owners somehow have to be to blame! How the hell do you allow someone so miserable represent your livelihood? You don't expect livelihood for very much longer, that's how.

Savers is the heaven and hell of Las Vegas thrift stores. You have to be willing to get dirty, to get on your knees and repent. You have to suffer through repeated disapointments in order to achieve the nirvana of a true thrift store find. 
First trip out - chewed up Barbie dolls and incomplete board games. Second trip - A set of Christmas lights marked for $2 more than at the Walmart they same from. But then, on the third trip back, there it is - the chimera. The unicorn. The 36"" 1970's black velvet painting of two tigers in flagrante delicto. The Elvis cookie jar. The wine cooler made out of an abandoned suit of armor. The red leather Michael Jackson Thriller jacket. A bronze toreador sculpture. And it's only $12.99.

ewmaCrLXQW7mg1Z4gAtgZg,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.

The enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were sautéed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.

Warning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas. 

By the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.

This place gets five stars and I can't wait to go back. Please, please try this place. It was empty when I walked in and that's a shame. They should have a lot more business if it was all based on the quality of their food and service. It's also very affordable.

xLPt2YOqBTJ1fNwC3bPdOw,"I've dined here a few times with my family and we keep coming back, despite a few misses.  I really want to be a fan of this place though. The red salsa is good and hot while the green satisfies the less adventurous.  The guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there.  I normally get the tacos, either brisket or fish and they're really great, though I'm not a fan of mango salsas in general.  
Last night we had the guac and a couple of Wednesday special margaritas which were just right.  We thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl, coupled with distracted waitstaff, became empty quickly.
My wife and I split the main dish, which was a special ""baked brisket enchilada"" recommended by the waitress.  It was huge and definitely more than enough for too, but we didn't care for it. There didn't seem to be much beef in it; it was mostly sauce and cheese. 
It will be awhile before we go again, and I think we'll stick to the tacos when we do. In summary, lots to like here, but I'd say stick to the basics.",3.0

The soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half.
Very disappointed in how much came on the sub. They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want.
I can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers!

I also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled.

We had a chimicurri steak burrito with chips as well as a cabo platter which is a burrito and taco. The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup.

I adore Ikea! There is nothing better to me than seeing a piece in it's functionality and how it will work in a room, hence, the showroom.

When you go to Ikea, it is simply a MUST to enjoy the top floor showroom area. What I would have given to have had Ikea in NC when I got my first apartment. Not only are the items affordable but seeing Ikea's recommendations of how to decorate, supply, and organize a living space in 640 sq. feet is a miracle! It totally works and somehow I find myself wanting to go live in a space that small! 

Ikea can be intimidating in it's size and there being SO MUCH STUFF but it is well worth it! I always go to Ikea with a list of items that I am needing for the home and I always find it, while also finding MUCH MORE to leave with. The greatest part of Ikea is the price! There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars/trucks/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea! This is a good thing because then the savings are passed along to you, the shopper!

Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!! They don't false advertise there either! Furious!  Their food and prices have gone downhill fast! They lost mine and my family's business for good!!",1.0

iSmfAVy6cApgXIYHsldsmA,"My husband and I used to order from here more than I'd like to admit (almost weekly). The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. 

Last time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.

I paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any ""inconvenience"" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. 

When we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. 

I walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or ""I'll be right with you."" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say ""Wow, you are really something else."" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. 

I honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.

I realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.",1.0

fPRmEOJy0DoT8P8YQDF5lQ,"I'm a fan of BMW.  My X3 lasted me 10 years and although there were a few hiccups, I can still say that car was pretty darn reliable and I got my money's worth. But sometimes, you just have to let go and find a replacement.

I did my research and considered getting a Mini, Fiat or a Lexus. My loyalty is with BMW. I locked in on a particular car and off to the dealer I went. We were walking around the lot looking at other models and colors when a car salesman saw us and helped me get my car. My sister kept throwing her ideas and opinions as to what car I should get. I told David (sales advisor) what features I need and we ended up with the first car I was looking at.

Then, the dreaded test driving the car. I'm not a big fan of driving a car that isn't mine...or driving, period! I think convincing me to test drive took the most time and David told me to just drive around the lot but that was a trick! There was a part of the lot that's blocked off by a semi and the only way around it is to get on the road. My sister was a backseat driver as if I needed to be more anxious but David kept me calm. He's so funny. We made it back to the dealership in one piece.

I signed my papers and wrote my check but it was gym time so, we told David we'd come back for the car after the gym since they still had to detail it anyway. It was the most entertaining car-buying experience ever. We were all laughing and chatting about cars, the gym, nutrition, Hello Kitty, Yoda, etc. David explained and showed me what my car can do and at the end he said, ""I wish all my clients are as fun as you.""

3Qc49B7dA0ONmCxrn5iwCQ,"OVERALL: The food isn't good (I explain below), but this place may still be worth locals' time (and more importantly money).  Let me explain...

There are not many ""old"" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value/frequent/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an ""Old Western Vegas"" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers. 

FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care? 

I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.  

I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese. 

A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush. 

SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks.

second A place that proudly serves ""Middle eastern"" and also ""Greek"" food usually misses those authentic flavors. For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion. 

And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good!

UuwV_kvSBEiRD0lbbUWNbg,"A tale of two locations (AKA: AVOID 7700 S Autoplex, GO TO 616 W Baseline)

First the good: 616 W Baseline

I have been a loyal repeat customer of Cobblestone Auto Spa ever since I encountered Jared, one of the managers at the 616 W Baseline. 

The first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.

I am not good with names or dates, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.

COBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!

Now the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex

I first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.

I then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.

I then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.

When I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.

Finally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.

I went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.

The next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat. 

I knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.

I suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.

As a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.

I went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee. 

They reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.

Jared to the rescue:

I took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.

The desperately needed water took almost twenty minutes to get to our table.

The table next to us, who was seated at least five minutes after us, received their water, drinks, and first course before we even got our water. 

Do I sound like I'm obsessing about water? In the desert, dehydration is no joke, and it's indicative of the quality (bad - very very bad) of service that we received.

The sushi was good, but not great.
The main courses were simple but extremely expensive.
All sides were extra.
We spent about $250 for three people on very basic food and a glass of wine each.

We got the Fajitas for 2 with Steak and Chicken, add cheese...so good, lots of flavor. Loved the fideo soup and chips with the onions and peppers, the salsa and bean dip were good although not my favorite.
My only other gripe is smelling of fajita when we left, I smelled like I had worked the grill, my clothes were saturated with the smell and my skin felt greasy. I had noticed the smell and cloud of smoke in the restaurant when we sat down. I'll just be sure not to have anything special planned after we eat here.

It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great.

Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey.

The restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us.  We waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came.   We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.

The young man grating the cheese played with his smartphone typing out a few messages. Replaced it to his pocket and continued handling the cheese without washing his hands or using any plastic gloves.

The young lady was cleaning dirty tables with a rag  and spray. Not a problem except when she was done she put the spray bottle up and didn't bother washing her hands either and went immediately to handling food items in the back.

Pizza was fine, but barely had enough cheese on it to cover it. Fair for the price.

w9vhFm9z4xZ5MFer1inIeg,The worst. Got there 45 minutes after the store was supposed to be open and they weren't ready.  Ordered a sandwich and the oven hadn't been turned on.  I asked how long and the employee said a few minutes. 8 minutes later oven still not preheated and I let her know I had to go.  She then pulls the sandwich out of the oven.  Cleary the sandwich would not have been prepared correctly.  I did not take sandwich and had to leave to get to an appointment. My  quick stop for a coffee and breakfast to go was over 15 minutes.  When I sent in a complaint to the head office the slow response was they couldn't give me a credit but would send over coupons for a couple of beverages.  That is ridiculous.  I wanted a refund on the sandwich I never took. I pass by this second cup 5 days a week. I'm going to keep on driving and stick with Starbucks. You should also steer clear.

hNO1_hkdUZDkqc-BjDHjrg,"These guys really are great, easy to work with, and provide a valuable service.

I worked with Sammy to coordinate a night out with 10 girls for a bachelorette party in Vegas.  We decided to go to Tryst.  Sammy was very patient in taking multiple phone calls and answering all my questions, even throwing in a couple of extra perks at my request.  The pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person, creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time.  We didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night.  It was SO easy.

Someone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out.  Sammy, knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us, called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different, better table open up, and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge.  

Craig was our host for the evening.  He contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when.  Craig was waiting to greet us and, as promised, walked us right into the club and to our table, which had our bottles, mixers and waitresses waiting.  Craig stopped back a couple of times before leaving to make sure we were settled and having a good time.

I contacted Sammy a couple more times throughout the weekend for various things, and he was more than helpful even though we weren't using them for additional reservations or nights out.

NSHW9BZ-FsScJyFSSRxHYQ,"2-3 years ago I found LifeScape Medical Associates randomly and started going there since then. Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.

There're a few reasons I don't like it there:
1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine/samples/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.

2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.

3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines. 

I normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody.",1.0
a_g4eysuYC1pI9tv3MCZxA,"I love the West Side Market but I can't stand the crowds, the parking, and the general gentrified douchery that seems to accompany the entire process. For me, it's just not worth it. Enter the Food Peddler Farmer's Market. I don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood, but I'd like to shake their hand. It's just what the doctor ordered.

Imagine, if you will, a bright, airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region, rows of farm fresh eggs, coolers filled with Amish chicken and local ground beef...yeah, right. No, really, it's true. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but for an area of Cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air. It does what Cleveland and the rest of the nation needs, it encourages consumption of fresh, local foods. So what do they have to offer?

-Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables with everything from plump bing cherries to more exotic fare like chayote and California avocados. 

-A bakery with Cleveland favorites like kugel and kolaczki and a deli stocked to overflowing with meats and cheeses from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania.

-A bulk section with plenty of flour, rice, pie fillings, nuts, seeds, and other goodies.

-Giant bags of peanuts, onions, apples, and carrots.

-A wall of bulk candy packaged in little containers perfect for hiding in your cupboard behind the quinoa and flax seeds.

-Reasonable prices. It's not as cheap as fast food, no. But if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health.

I could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but I want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit. I know, it's not the West Side Market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway.

The food is the thing in any restaurant and pretty much everything was just ok. Our salesman/server;) confidently stated the steak tacos were the best menu item, and they were, but still only rated a just above average 3.5.

I had a ribeye with mashed and seasonal vegetables that was not coked to medium as requested (who knows why they ask in spots like this because it is pretty much never done right?). The accompanying sauce was actually very good and that saved this dish for me.

I first went in to see a couple of puppies, and I really like 2 in particular.  Because I already have a dog at home, and my boyfriend wasn't able to join me, I put one of them on hold (they will hold your pet for the day) and went back a few hours later.  It is required that if you already have a dog, you must do an introduction to make sure it is a good match.  My dog loved Sayuri, but was not as fond of the other dog.  I like to say that my dog chose our new puppy :).  

When adopting a puppy, you also recieve a free exam through the VCA Animal Hospitals.  I think that's wonderful since adopting a rescue dog can be intimidating.

Wanted the car to be reliable and not have any issues so I went ahead with all the required maintenance and then some.

1 month after all this major service the radiator blew open coming back from flagstaff.....Ok so I understand things break etc.  I take it to Arrowhead Honda Service and the explanation was since I replaced the water pump with a new one it must have increased pressure in the system. Since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator.  I was then told it was common??? OK I get the explanation, but if that was the case a month a go and common knowledge why not recommend replacing the radiator with the major service so the car would not leave me stranded???

They also had recommended the power steering pump be replaced, system flushed etc.  Hate when its not done right the first time?  Had to bring it back and wait for them to get air out of the system so the new power steering pump would stop making noise.

24 hours access with your keycard
no-contract membership options
lockers (bring your own lock)

mbVzxuQTLRPbK-RwoGJsbA,"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.

We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  

My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  

In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.

JO1EOjDfMdvC2Vrw5P-Baw,"The service was pretty bad. There were these two grouchy ladies dealing with us at the entrance and we have to wait ridiculously long for a table even though the restaurant is almost empty. Then we have to sit as far away from the food as possible. When we ask to sit closer they say no. We ask why and they say no one is covering that area. Seems like they could easily fix that or make one exception, I mean its a buffet. we won't be needing much service if any. 

Luckily that lady who took our drink orders was pretty nice and came over often to clear our plates and refill our mimosas. 

The food at the buffet was one of the better buffets I've had in Vegas, definitely better than Monte Carlo's or Harrah's, but nothing compared to Paris or Mirage. I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas. 

One really cool feature here is the salad bar, where they make you a salad fresh for you. I really enjoyed the Chinese Chicken Salad. There's also a dessert area that has more choices than a lot of the other buffets, though the execution of them aren't so great. 

Definitely worth going to for the food, but I really thought the service was the worst out of all the restaurants I went to in Vegas. For those reasons I probably won't go back, but I wouldn't tell people not to go.",3.0

Poor choice in closing the extra room after all these years.

-2j4m2ffQgPx93fszFN-yg,"This is the worst gym I've ever been to, and I've grown up in the gym business. These guys only care about your money and nothing more. When I joined I later had to cancel with them because I had to meet with my National Guard unit and I didn't know what kind of schedule I'd have. They seemed understanding and said it wasn't a problem. At this time I would have rated this gym very good, because I had fun with no issues. I even told them I'd probably start back up here after I know what schedule looked like. So I stop going after my month expired because I cancelled(even on my attendance sheet it said it was my last and only month.) I later check my bank statement and they charged me again, okay no big deal probably a mistake. I call them, no answer. Okay that's fine I'll email them explaining the mistake. I'll give them a few days to get back to me max. Hear nothing from them. Call them again, no answer. Call them again they finally answered. I explain the situation with guy that answers and he says ""Oh yeah i got your email but I forgot to call you."". At this point I'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service. Then after that he tells me no I haven't cancelled and I'm going to have to pay another two months worth. He tells me I must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken English so he must have misunderstood me when I cancelled with him a month prior to this). He won't help me out at all, just says I have to pay more. Thank god I have Navy Federal for a bank because I call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me. They repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym, they also put a stop payment on the gym. Well sure and behold I get charged by them AGAIN and I call my bank asking why did this happen? Turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment. I ask what I can do. They say to email them so I have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie.

I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait.
I was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the ""sex sells"" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally. 
To be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.

ionasM2PY_2TFbK5Dkgg6Q,"Being an avid Hookah smoker with a pipe of my own I probably have a little more knowledge about Shisha and the procedures than I need, with that being known this place doesn't clean the pipes after each use and as stated with another review it really doesn't matter a whole lot what flavor you are interested in, double apple is what you will eventually end up tasting.  They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right. 

Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere.

And she made up an excuse saying how ""Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy"" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted.

We arrived at Hertz at around 2:15 PM on Aug. 24th and was able to get our rental in about 20-25 minutes.  The pick up process is pretty simple.  You can either go to a customer service rep or use their self-serve kiosk, which is what I ended up doing.

The lady who was assisting me on the kiosk phone was pretty friendly, but she was doing a lot of up-sell so it was kind of bothersome.  I didn't need a bigger car than an economy size since there was only 2 of us.  I understand that they probably work off of commission, but sometimes it's unnecessary to try and convince you to get something that you don't need.

The return process was pretty quick and easy as well.  I ended up getting charged for an extra day because I brought the car back 1.5 hours after the pick up time since my flight didn't leave until 8 PM.  Too bad they don't have a ""grace"" period for regular customers.

Other than that the car was fine.  I didn't get anything fancy, just a KIA so nothing much to write about--other than the fact that it was clean and didn't smell bad like some other rentals that I've encountered elsewhere.",3.0
HJOHmSJONel2m6Qg9eyR7g,"Had the occasion over the last few weeks to experience their sports medicine/physical therapy department.  Outstanding.  Drs. Anthony ""Tony"" Walker and Jennifer Hannon are a great team.  They really know their stuff.

Beyond knowing their stuff is their continual dialogue with patients.  On each appointment we began discussing how the exercises were working, how I was feeling, what is working or not.  Then we would get into planning for that day and going forward.

I was involved in the therapy.  And we continued in this joint planning over a month of treatments.

They administer a tablet form of survey asking about your condition and how it is affecting your life.  After the therapy has run its course you complete the same survey, so they have a before and after record of your condition.

Impressive and given the people cycling through this practice it was clear that the facility and all the therapists were doing something special.

3qwgrPW0hOaWi8R4FYQMBw,"This show was fun, but i was expecting more from all the hype it gets. We picked this over Chippendales cuz the idea of Australian men with their accents is so much hotter than American dancers =P. When I called in to purchase tickets an hour before the show, they said that they didn't have a table to fit 5 girls, and that we would have to separate into two tables, which was fine. But when we got there, there was 2 completely empty tables in the front of the stage! The sales people were really unorganized to not notice that was available! So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table, which gave a much better view.

The show was def entertaining, with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome, something about a man in a g-string is just wrong, you know? but nonetheless, it was very entertaining. The emcee's accent was hot, and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate, and some of the older women too, which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well, so no matter where your seats were, I think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys.

Downside though, at the end of the show, you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys, only to receive one picture. no offense, but that is a total rip off. i've been to Fantasy, which is a female stripshow,  and you can take pics with them for free, and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show, and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf? These men seemed way too jaded and full of themselves. They may be good to look at, but off-stage they're total jerks.

He went to Burrito Boyz.  His only regret?  Not getting a large.

He's pretty much bang on.  There's very little to regret when it comes to Burrito Boyz.  Their burritos are big and filled to the point of bursting with delicious flavours.  I usually go for the small, because the large really is very large, but I'll indulge once in a while.

They've got a variety of meats you can choose from.  Some favourite being chicken, halibut and beef.

Everything is great really.  Even their level of spice, is always bang on for me.  You can request that they withhold certain things like hot sauce or jalopenos, but trust me, it's not that bad.",4.0
yR7mcnvyM2ky1xYUeim_Xw,"Mr Cool Heating and Air Conditioning came to the rescue for me on short notice AND was able to work on a swamp cooler, which many companies do not. 

We have three dogs of our own and we foster dogs, so when it started to heat up here in Vegas we were worried when the swamp cooler didn't seem to be blowing out air as cold as it normally does. I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help. 

Swamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again. I asked questions about how to best maintenance our swamp cooler and he was happy to answer. I'm very glad we chose Mr Cool and would HIGHLY recommend Derek as he was so patient, kind, and hardworking. Swamp coolers are a pain for repair so if they were affordable for our repair I'm sure they're even better with AC units. Thank you Derek and Mr Cool, our house gets soooo cold now, just how I like it!",5.0

Tv87VbmTrCVlGukNUvdAsQ,"Battista's Hole In the Wall is awesome! Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.

It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.

Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.",4.0

An extra star for the legendary Iraqi fish dish known as 'Masgoof.'  If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.

In most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2007 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the stars.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.

The interiors and décor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.

I contacted him several times for him to get my car fixed he kept saying that he would fix it after the holidays. January, February passed the car was not fix yet. I contacted him one las time, I told him that I would give him one more month than he told me that he has been working on it still. He told me that it was an imported part witch was not easy to find. I told him I will take legal action and he than answered with '' do whatever you have to do'' with a arrogant tone so unprofessional till now I can say that he has NEVER!!! Contacted me!!! To keep me updated or give me a solution. I believe I have been more than patient at this time it is incredible how they claim to be a legal business.

In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, "" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy"".

I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills.

Doctor Youssef first helped my boyfriend when his cat had a horrible hairball stuck in her stomach. He shows so much compassion and understanding for animals it is hard not to believe he truly cares for their well being.

He is not afraid to tell you if you are harming your pet. If they are overweight, he will tell you straight up and let you know you are causing them harm. If you are an uptight suburbian, then don't go to him. He will tell you that you are killing your dog feeding them 'Puppocinos'. Which you are.

I started taking my dog here after she expressed her hatred of her previous vet, who felt that it was 'no big deal' and that they could always just muzzle her or sedate her for check ups. I felt that was ridiculous and brought her to Doctor Youssef who felt the same and is doing everything in his power to make her comfortable with him and his staff. He has even let me take her around the whole building just to get use to it. 

His prices are very fair, and he himself is the most trustworthy vet I have yet to meet. One conversation with him and you can tell he does not care about money, he is truly one of the very few who are in this business just because they care about animals.

We had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.

Fast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.

We called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as ""assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres"" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.

When we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide. 

Needless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.

No big deal till you understand the rest.. this is a cheap way to not refill system and do it right...  After going to get my car when they said it was done I Notice AC didn't work and wrong Coolant added to Radiator. ( cannot use regular Green... Yellow Ford required ) Then I say I will come get it when they fix the AC, they tell me hours later its the PCM..( Computer ) well OK you guys shorted it out, the only thing wrong was a Valve Rattle, now this??

IT WAS NOT THE PCM.. this place MIGHT be good for a Oil Change if you tell them how to do it, but that's all..  Telling me How Do we know you didn't bring it in here like this...

A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as ""butter"" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates!
The end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came.

Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's true, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed!

Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.

For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.

I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.

I got incredibly fed up and walked inside. There were 2 tables seated - and they were already eating. One woman was ordering at the counter when I went in. 
     I asked the worker at the counter if they shut down the drive thru and if they could inform the people waiting at the speaker because we were stuck and just wanted to leave.

We are STILL stuck in your crappy little drive thru and we don't even want to order here anymore. He said he would meet me outside - which he DIDNT by the way, but the line started to move so we said whatever and decided to still order because we had already waited 40 minutes.
     After they got the person in front of us through the drive thru, they then told US to hold on a minutes because they are ""backed up inside"", but they weren't at all. The parking lot had 2 cars and 3 people behind us in line, and when I was inside, a server was sitting at a table texting. So don't tell me you are busy if your staff is getting paid for nothing.

Personally, I don't do cheap beer, and nothing else looked good, so I stuck with water. At this, she snickers, ""so just water and some apps.....MMMKAYY"" while giving stink eyes. Excuse me?

jslZnOFu2Oa-2MZ7Ud1O8g,"If you like thin greasy pizza, then Alexander's Pizza is good for you. The $6 large pizza is a nice deal, and I do admit the flavor is marginally better than Caesar's $5 pizza. The only problem was how sparse the cheese was and the cardboard box the pizza sat in was literally soaking WET from being drenched in oil. 

Alexander's pizza also serves Italian and Greek entree meals. The pizza was disappointing, but their homemade (?) ranch dressing is out of this world! It's creamy, thick, and very nicely seasoned to go with their surprisingly fresh salads. Their ranch dressing really is superb and the family that runs this place seem very nice. Not the friendliest bunch of people, but you can tell their honest and work hard.",4.0

One didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no, it completely broke in less than a month. It won't even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly!

gCLbUG4PnhwhBKR_5jARjw,"Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.
The decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.

cYyE6CHzwJkDD6wukfit0A,"I loved my little cake, but the owner is her own worst enemy to her business. A friend took me there because we went on a cupcake tasting that day. He said a better product was awaiting me as the grand finale. When I walked in the store, I didn't know who the owner was, until my friend pointed it out when we left. I wanted to take a look around, it was nicely decorated, but I could clearly see the person in charge slightly annoyed that I wanted to browse before buying. I explained it my first time at the store and she pushed me to buy a large cake. I explained again that I was not from Scottsdale and am only one person. So I'm not going to buy a large cake. When we started talking a bit more, I could see her employees sort of clam up. I had no idea what was going on. When I chose my little cake, any sort of customer service went out the window once the money transaction occurred.  She didn't even say, ""Thank you,"" It was so unusual for a bakery or any business dealing with customers. I was upset and quite frankly, so angry that I wanted to turn around an return my cake and tell the owner to keep my money. I am not rich - I am passionate about bakeries and tour around when I'm in a new town to support local business. I was genuinely interested in hearing about the seasonal cake that she was trying to sell me. I had heard through other locals that they love the cakes, but not the owner when she's in the shop because she's so rude. I give this a two stars because I liked the cakes, but the service was very, very caustic that I could not justify scoring more. She cuts people off  - that was feedback I had received from previous customers. My local friends said that they cannot build rapport with the service workers there because there is always a new person. That made me wonder what was going on. I was trying to figure out how she stayed in business, but then heard she has a contract that keeps her afloat to sell cakes to a prominent medical clinic. I love the cakes there - the store is creative, but I sense a level of stress that turned me off. If it's the economy, that's one thing, but in the U.S., customer service is not taken lightly and I will probably seek out another Nothing Bundt Cakes for the product, but not return due to the principle of how rude the service was.",2.0

SVOxLL37tIeTzPEukht18g,"I had two different experiences with Carpet Monkey. In both instances the person who came to clean was on time and it was easy to get a hold of the company when I needed to. Also, they call around 15-30 minutes beforehand to let you know they are on the way. This is a great help since I had to drive 45 minutes to meet them so it was nice knowing how far they were. Their price was also quite good since I requested 4 rooms upstairs, hallway, stairs, and downstairs bedroom. Now the first experience I had was on 09/15. The person who came to clean was Mark. I was not satisfied at all with his work. He didn't clean a good 2 inches from the walls around the whole perimeter of the house. The stairs looked worse than before he came. There were soo many stains that he said should come out that were still there and the carpet was extra crunchy after it dried. Any time we tried to mention something to him we would always get the same response that he's been doing this for 28 or 30 years and wouldn't really listen to our concern. In a normal situation that would warrant an instant 1 star review since I chose this company based on over 500 positive reviews and the pictures seemed great. The work I had gotten done on 09/15 was not anywhere near what the pictures looked like. However instead of rushing to yelp I figured this company doesn't have 500 plus good reviews for nothing and called them up around 09/20. This is where I can really appreciate this company's commitment to customers. When I called I believe the owner picked up. If I remember correctly his name was Rick. I told him everything that happened and he was very cooperative about the fact that I wasn't satisfied at all with Mark's work. He said he'll send his right hand man Joe out and we were quickly able to schedule for 09/22. Again communication is very easy with this company. On top of that Rick told me the second visit wouldn't be of charge. So Saturday comes and we get a phone call from Isaac saying he's on his way, again great communication. I didn't worry too much that it wasn't Joe at our door like I was told since Isaac seemed like he knew what to do in these situations where the previous work wasn't satisfactory. He let me show him where I wasn't satisfied and could see where and why some of the stains didn't come out and said he'll go over all the areas. I was surprised since I thought he'd just go over the areas with spots only. But he went over everything all over again and everything looked A LOT better. The stairs actually looked like they had been cleaned this time and Isaac also went ahead and did the risers which I wasn't expecting. There were some stains that wouldn't come out but he had mentioned that to us. Overall his work actually resembled some of the yelp pictures and the carpets weren't nearly as crunchy when dried after Isaac went over them. He also put the corner protectors on the wall which I appreciated (something Mark didn't do). So my first experience was not good at all but the company was quick to help resolve the issue and reiterated how they wanted the customer to be happy and would do whatever they could to ensure that. This alone earns praise from me since it shows they care enough to at least try and make things better. Second experience with Isaac was WAY better and communication with the company is a breeze. Thank you Isaac and Rick!",5.0

R4ox2uOJsXHwRTODx0nKyg,"We ate here for a friend's birthday before seeing Ka (theater is right next to this restaurant in the MGM Grand). It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us.

If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)

There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow ""oversized"" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.

OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!

The suites are large, well equipped (full kitchen with a dishwasher in ours--I loved storing all  of our leftovers in our full fridge) with a full walk out balcony furnished with a patio table and four chairs.  The attached bedroom was large and outfitted with a King size bed.  As much as we liked the room, we obviously didn't spend tons of time in it since we hung out on the Strip during much of the day and night.

Kinda strange: there was a box TV in the bedroom and there was a flatscreen TV in the living room.  Not a big deal, but perhaps a little outdated.

I never made it to the pool or spa (although the pool area looked lovely and quiet, and I had read great things about the spa and had intended to use it before I left the hotel).

The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????",2.0

It's okay, but if you've had steak tartare done right before skip it here. They use a chicken egg yolk. Tartare itself is not seasoned enough and left more to be desired. Salmon quinoa bloated. Duck fries were quite good and a large portion too. In terms of fruity beers, I didn't like my friend's cherry beer (reminded me of medicine taste(, but my peach beer was quite interesting and more bitter than I thought.

The decor is trendy and interesting, it's Cleveland-centric, and they offer great vegan options. When our group entered the store, we were warmly welcomed and given an explanation of how everything worked. It's a per-ounce froyo place with lots of possibilities. I chose the artisan organic tart yogurt and the vegan blueberry...mmm. One thing to note is that because it's vegan (made with coconut milk), it's not as creamy and melts a bit quicker if you're not used to vegan things. Yum. 

They have lots of topping options, along with organic MOCHI and tons of fruit. They also have nutella and flavored bubbles! I usually go with the mochi and fruit with froyo, and all of it was very fresh.

We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise.
The experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good.
The flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible.

QpwGPaQT-KCsfnEnEaE5qQ,"To whomever owns Lucki Thai:   Lucki is actually spelled with a y.   Sheesh, how embarrassing.   Beyond the (yes, I do realize it was intentional) misspelling of the name of the restaurant, Lucki Thai doesn't miss on many marks for me.

I've had the opportuniti to dine in, get carri out, and order deliveri (I'll stop this now) from Lucki on many occasions in the last few months, so I can tell you that no matter which method you decide to go with for your thai food fix there you won't be disappointed.  The first time I had Lucki I dined in and had the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp and their Crab Fried rice.  The Tom Yum Soup is consistently good, and I'd know since it's been a staple of every single order I've made with Lucki since.  It's always hot, with the perfect combination of sour and spicy, and loaded with mushrooms and an ample amount of shrimp.  The large order feeds 2 perfectly.  The crab fried rice is not something I tend to order, but Lucki's version definitely packed a lot of crab flavor.   They also weren't shy with the egg on the rice, and being an egg slut like Anthony Bourdain, that pleased me.

I've done a mix of delivery and take-out many times since, and every time the delivery is at the house by the promised time (usually well before), and the food has almost always been ready to go when I arrive for a carry-out order.  

Of the items I've ordered those times, the curries have been phenomenal, as has the spicy eggplant entree.   I wish I could explain what makes the eggplant there stand out over other places that I've had similar dishes, but I usually gobble it up so fast there's no time for me to remember any particulars about the dish other than it's absolutely delectable.  I'm also a huge fan of their brown rice option, even though it's $2 extra.   Lucki's brown rice is one of the only in the city that I feel is worth whatever upcharge they want for it.   I'm pretty sure it's not just brown rice but a mix of wild and brown rice.   I also really liked the Rad Na, though my laziness knows no bounds in that I felt like it was a lot of work eating it.   It's truly shameful.   

The only order I wasn't completely thrilled with so far was the Beef Pad See Ewe.  The flavors were nice, but the beef was tough and chewy.   A simple misstep which I can forgive.

I have to admit I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 for the only thing that has gotten on my nerves a bit with Lucki Thai thus far:   spice consistency.   I started by ordering level 6 and 7 which is my normal go-to at other Thai joints, but didn't find them spicy enough.   I've now settled on an 8, which at most places would feel like it was burning a hole in my esophagus with each swallow.   Getting delivery a few weeks ago and ordering an 8, it had literally ZERO spice.  It actually might have gotten into the negatives.   It's quite frustrating because I suspect if I move into the 9-10 category the chef stops even paying attention and probably just dumps a whole barrel of ghost chiles into the pan.   WHAT'S MY NEXT MOVE HERE?

But alas, the service and food are simply too good even with that inconsistenci.  Sorry I couldn't resist.",5.0

pW0YWe0xoQQZIfc-NKvUnQ,"I was sent to Vision Source South Hills for a second opinion. I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: ""patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance"". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service.

Like some of the other reviews mentioned, the salon doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside everything is great. The facility is clean, but what makes the difference for me is the fact that the staff there was so friendly, and welcoming. All of the technicians were talking with the clients and there were even a few friendly group conversations between everyone in the salon. It was very comfortable! Most of the ladies in there during my appointment were regular clients and they had nothing but good things to say about the place after learning that it was my first time there. Loyal clientele is always a good sign. 
Johnny did my acrylic nails (full set) which I am totally in love with. He did a great job and was also really personable.

vsd6DoMG32MB6W-3Ht3b8A,"My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12"" x 12"" square and 10-12"" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8"" square base, next layer 6"" base and the top layer 4"" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4"" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2"" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.",1.0

The gentleman that showed up was instantly able to locate the problem and solution - terrible install design by the home builders - and my dad actually was able to make the repair with the technician's directions. The service charge was more than reasonable and I was just relieved to be able to continue using the AC. We just called them out again today to check our system as the vents do not blow equally throughout the house resulting in hot spots and cool spots. The very same technician came out and looked at our system again - and again all of our issues are due to how cheaply made the house was back in 1999 - and spent about 20 minutes teaching us how to have better air flow and utilize the vents in the house wisely.

While Savers deserves five stars, the adhesive on the back of the price tags is very hard to remove and the frustration level is palpable. When they put it on the inside of the shoe bottom, and you try to remove it, it leaves a gooey residue that is all but fun when you slip on a pair of shoes in warm weather and your foot is sweaty. Ignoring the schmuck sound when you lift up your foot to walk due to it sticking to the shoe, it doesn't feel very good.

You can put these price tags directly on leather and they don't stick because leather breathes. It's the synthetic material they use for the inside of shoes where adhesive really only does ""its thing"" leading to frustration.

Hey, look its Viva Mercados!

[my aunt] so you've been there?!

[me] No.. but lets try it.

Walking in the decor was the usual.. whats the word.. oh yes.. Festive. But then again thats what you find at every mexican restaurant.

Quick, friendly service. Lady explained to us the specials and what different words meant that i hadn't heard before. Add, 1 more star.

Didn't try the chips, salsa or bean dip. I'm just not one to fill up on that stuff then take two bites of my food. No, i wanted to have a empty stomach for my meal so that i could write about my experience. [yes, i know im just brilliant, no need for the pat on the back]

The food came and it was hot. It was delicious, mostly cause i was starving.. but it wasn't something that was spectacular. My mother in law makes better beans and rice. The taco cracked as soon as i took a bite. Thats another pet peeve. Inside I cried a little.. Now all the meat cheese and lettuce was going to fall out. Well, that ruined my taco experience. Boo. The chile relleno was delish. Cooked to perfections and de-seeded, just the way I like it. Adding 1 more star just for the chile relleno. Overall it was good

Would have given it another star but this place is way over priced. Can we say expensive. Especially because this place isn't on the strip. Their prices are the same as Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and they're portions aren't as big or as good. Sorry Viva Mercados, I will not be coming back.",3.0

607yTunGJNzx4v9iKhmTVw,"The first & most important thing you need to know is this place is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY, leave the kids at home because they are certainly not welcomed...they're allowed inside but make sure they leave any kind of expression of joy at the door before entering. 

Second thing to know, INDOOR VOICES ONLY. Whispered excitement guarantees you won't be asked to leave. Yes, it's a pinball arcade, but it's a ""MUSEUM"" pinball hall of fame. 

Third & last thing (I think) to know is not to expect favorable employee characteristics. At least not from the guy with the gray ponytail...especially not from him actually, maybe just avoid all contact with him if possible. 

Once you understand those 3 essential things you are sure to enjoy your time. With rows of pinball machines there is plenty to check out, the variety is not lacking. You can certainly stretch $10-20 into a good couple hours worth of play.

B4tz9-3R62_FFZDK5Ud0XA,"OK, my first yelp review, so bear with me. I tend to break things down into categories, so I'll go with that for now.
Atmosphere: Confusing. Decor is kinda kitschy, supposedly to evoke dinner at mom's or something of that order. Yeah, if you have really loud obnoxious relatives; maybe it's due to the construction of the space, but the place was LOUD! For the price (more about that later), this is a special-occasion restaurant for most of us, but I wouldn't recommend it for an romantic/intimate one. 
Service: No complaints here. Our server (Eric, I believe) was extremely pleasant and most helpful. He took the time to explain some of the menu items, checked on us fairly often, and  was generally very friendly. High marks here.
Food (quality): Again, very few complaints. Food was fresh and flavorful; portions, while not huge, were pretty satisfying. My wife had the roasted beet salad (actually part of the 4-course special but our server told us we could order it a la carte) and enjoyed it very much. I started with the Caesar...the black garlic dressing was delicious! Highly recommended!  My wife's filet mignon was well prepared and presented; I had the brick oven chicken and was very pleased. Moist, tasty, and the mac & cheese was excellent. Topped off with the Brookie for dessert, a very nice meal.
Food (value): And here's why I tend to shun trendy restaurants. A cocktail, a glass of wine, a beer, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert: just this side of $140. Brief breakdown: the beer, although a John Smith from England, was served out of a can! Some may call this ""ironic""; I say, ""tacky!"" The aforementioned beet salad? A few pieces of beet, a little arugula, a dollop of ricotta...$14! And although my chicken was very good, one medium-sized chicken breast doesn't warrant a price over $20. And before the Summerlin crowd starts chanting ""Go back to Denny's"", I'm talking value, not price. My last two steakhouse meals (Silverado and Circus Circus) were each about $30 less for a comparable meal.
So, all in all, good, not great, and not worth the price.",3.0

The Empanadas were perfectly cooked and juicy, not dry at all. The street corn, which is a favorite of mine, was the best I have had so far. I can highly recommend their shrimp and steak tacos which were soft and had great flavor. We ordered sliced avocado, creamy cold quacamole and together with the rosa sauce and fresh lime on the side made for a meal levels above what we paid for or expected. I love that you have so many choices to choose from to make up a meal that will satisfy any food cravings or preferences you might have and it is fresh and clean.

w8WLI9kVxcWi-H4W6j1f7A,"I will say that the unsalted edemame was not expected or appreciated. A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.

I thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.

As for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.

The service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.

There was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.

If you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back.",4.0
BleJTqbz6iRJudMrFOxQsg,"I'm very surprised that after 20+ reviews this place has a 4 1/2 average rating.  First off, so you don't think I'm some elitist bastard, let me state that I happily eat food at IHOP and Denny's.
  Anyway, so as I was with a bunch of college friends last weekend in Vegas, apparently eating at The Peppermill was a MUST?!? The decor of the place with it's bright neon rainbow purplish lights was a felt like a cross between Denny's and a Strip Club..I don't really dig that kind've ambience unless i'm actually in a strip club...
    Service was okay nothing really stood out as good or bad, and prices are actually good for being on the strip and having burgers around $9-10 and steaks  are like $25 (although i'd rather spend $5-10 more and go to a legit steakhouse).  
   So why 2 stars? well..the food absolutely sucked.  I ordered a Swiss mushroom burger w/curly fries.  First off, the burger and curly fries LOOKED delicious..but upon eating my food..I found absolutely no taste in any of the food, even after adding tons of salt and pepper to it. It's as if some mixture of oil and plastic got in my food that negated anything that could add taste to my food. Plus the mayo I got came in this bowl and let's say something about it's color and texture didn't look right.
  Anyway, the service and price were okay, decor a little dirty feeling for my taste. But what really killed it was that the food lacked any taste at all. Save your money and go to In & Out Burger at the other end of the strip, or even Burger King much closer at O'Sheas.

So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it.

Come to find out they switched me and my homies Burgers. Although her meat was well done and dry as well. My homie is breaking out (tomato allergy) and I'm just over the burger. 

They were nice enough to comp our burgers and asked if we wanted new ones. We were good with that. They also said they would give us free dessert. OKAAAAY!!!

New Burgers come out, they get the toppings right and the chef wasn't as enthusiastic with the mustard the second go round. HOWEVER! My meat was still dry and over cooked. {sigh}.... whatever. I couldn't finish the burger. Like the meat was a choking hazard. 

The Mac and cheese was aight. I love Gouda, but it wasn't hittin it. Ah well.

My other homie said her crab cake was too juicy. I didn't get much else from her meal but she did say this place was 2 star worthy as well. 

Also we get the complimentary bread and butter AFTER we get our food. The homie has to ask for the bread and butter. Strange and not needed at that point. 

The desserts (forgot to take pics) were actually really good. The hummingbird cake was moist and not too sweet. I don't like nuts but I had several bites anyway cause the flavor was really good. 

The oatmeal cream pie cookie joint was pretty good but again I'm not a fan of nuts and thick creamy icing. But anyone who is down for this, would love it! 

So there you have it. 

The service was top notch. I gave more than 20% of what my bill would have been because I can't fault the staff, but I'm sorry guys, the food needs some work. 

The location and setup is dope. The vibe is chill and everyone is really attentive and nice. If they work on the food, I can see this place getting packed with the quickness.",2.0

I mean seriously I get bottle service every single time and I do not get there later than 10-1030 pm sure the club may still be empty but i would muchhh rather hang out at my sickkk table than wait in a line for 2 hours.

uNvd2Bzic2fVBh4EalsRJw,"Oddly enough, it was a negative Yelp review that drew me to Diamond's in the first place (a review I see is no longer on Yelp). But after putting up with crappy service just to get the Sourdough burger I love, the argument with a man who was either the GM or the owner about whether a service dog could come in his bar was the last straw. 

I'm not sure why he thinks he can refuse service to someone coming in with a service dog, but that was the last straw for me.

aRidF5IYq5VoK5oMgFu43Q,"When looking up hotels to stay in, I was skeptical about this and many other hotels, as one usually is in a city the've never visited. However, I was extremely pleased with my stay at Platinum.

Location: Located next to an AM/PM gas station. This was great because I could pregame on the cheap before we went to various places. The hotel is very visible but still in the cut. About a half mile or so from the Venetian.

Customer Service: When I walked in, I was greeted with warmth. It was about 1 am, so not many people were in the lobby. Which was actually the case throughout my entire trip. I chatted with the front desk associate like we were old friends. He was just that nice. And he made me feel so welcome!

Room: Can I tell you that this room was EVERYTHING in LIFE?! Ok. There I told you. I was in room 402 I believe. This room was in fact a suite. I felt like it was an apartment and I had a lease. Freaking HUGE! It had separate areas for a kitchen (complete with full fridge, stove / oven, microwave, dishwasher and bar), living room, balcony, bedroom with 2 queen beds, a safe, closet and tv and bathroom with closet, garden tub, separate bathroom and double sink vanity. The bathroom was the size of most rooms. Completely clean!!!!

I stayed in it by myself. What a wondrous time!!!!!!! I had everything I needed and then some. And the view! Perfect view of the strip. It's the perfect way to be a part of Vegas without all the noise and smoke you get in a hotel with a casino. At half the price. Or less, depending on when you go. My first night in Vegas was spent relaxing in my beautiful room.

Tip: Even if you can't go get a full massage or service at the spa, at least purchase a cupcake bath salt from them and use in that beautiful tub. So relaxing!

I will def be bringing my sister and cousin back this March! Can't wait!

D64a7grXSsW2P7hJi_oRXQ,"Great place.  We stayed at the Hermosa Inn, and dinner and breakfast at Lon's were included as part of our package.  We were warmly greeted by the gentleman who was the host upon entering.  Dinner was fantastic - the strip steak was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  Started with the tortilla soup and finished with the panna cotta.  But our favorite part of the meal was the side of truffle fries - wow!  Thought it was great that they had local beer options from McFate Brewing on tap - rare to find them on tap around the valley outside of the brewery.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful, and my wife got a birthday card from the staff since it was her birthday. 

We returned for breakfast the next day.  Breakfast menu was considerably smaller and a lot less options, but the food was really good.  I had the ham & cheese omelette, which was great.  Large portion of toast accompanied my omelette, and the crispy potatoes that came with the omelette were really good.

I'd say the quality of fish, rice and seaweed is good to very good. I had 3 rolls and walked away full and content. It's not the very best sushi I've ever had but it's a great choice here in Scottsdale.

Also.... the water gets murky after a while.  Do you really want to go in there?  You would be putting yourself at risk for foot fungus or STDs.

_n1KOx4chiwrM5y_0m0IcQ,"This is my second visit; my first was back during CES in Jan. with a young friend visiting Vegas for the first time and who had never had a bloody mary...

Service was very good, the LARGE Bloody Mary was impressive, and the Jack Daniel's chocolate cake was to die for.

I liked it enough to want to go again.

Except for the BIG Bloody Mary meal - slim jim, pickles, cheese cubes, peppers,  candied bacon !!!!; sausage; red onion (see pics, only large U6 shrimp were missing. ..) everything else was a disappointment.

Service was very strange - the smiles were abundant, but everything else about the service was off, from how scarce our server was, to her not willing to take an order for breakfast from us,  yet a table seated after us served by someone else got breakfast; to how long it took to place our orders, to how long it took to get our order.

I got the wings - terrible, even though they are a signature dish. Bland, small, bones broken with sharp points and bone chips all throughout...now that I think about it, I don't know why I didn't complain and send it back. 

Maybe I was too consumed consuming the bowl sized meal of a Bloody Mary.

I'd go back just for that; I'd stay away for everything else (well, the Jack Daniels chocolate cake makes a compelling point...)

LBh-oRd5enTZBoNiKhHpmA,"BRFC is a solid place to try some really good chicken. I've been very happy on my recent visits to BRFC. Our chicken combos were tender, juicy, crispy, and flavorful. We like to order their chicken tender combos and dip them in all their different sauces. My husband and I really enjoy it and plan on returning. 

Pros: 

* Friendly & efficient service when you order at the counter 
* Clean and modern decor with plenty of seating/table options and large windows
* Large TVs (we watched football during one of our visits) 
* Combos include their shoestring fries and small cup of coleslaw
   Fries: skinny, crispy, salty, and plentiful | Coleslaw: a bit bland for my taste
* Their juicy chicken has a nice crisp crunch with a tasty and flavorful seasoning. 
  Their chicken is delicious with a slight spicy dry coating (a hint of cajun) 
  We do not find it to be greasy and the breading was light and not overwhelming 
* Their Boylan pop is served at a soda fountain and is sweetened with cane sugar and refillable
* Their iced tea is sweetened with honey or unsweetened and refillable
* Milkshakes are thick and creamy and my husband always orders one with his chicken
* Honey Dipping Sauce options: wildflower, chipotle and wasabi honey flavors 
  I LOVE all their honey options for my chicken tenders 
* Other Dipping Sauce options: habanero hot sauce and their own BRBBQ barbecue dip
* Lunch Box Special Deal:  M-F |  11am - 4pm  | 3 whole wings, fries, and a drink = 8 bucks 

Cons: 

* It seems a bit pricey for what it is. Essentially, it is priced a little higher than what you would expect for a chicken joint. You're looking at $10 - $15 a person for combos. However, I do find it to be a higher quality than most chicken joints. It's an upscale atmosphere for a 'fast casual' restaurant.

 Its more American Mexican food but it was good!

The service I recieved was 5 stars. Everyone was nice, I noticed there was mostly teenagers working there, and they were very friendly and helpful.  They checked up on us to make sure everything was alright, but they weren't overly obtrusive to where you feel bothered.  They put some restaurants to shame, and this isn't even that type of restaurant.

We eventually went in and sat at a table for dinner.  The chicken and waffle appetizer was delicious.  For entrees we ordered the shrimp and grits and the steak.  Everything was delicious except for that the cook could not get my steak right.  They tried three times to achieve medium rare but just couldn't get it right.  Fortunately, for me our waitress who was fabulous was more upset about it than I was.  She would take it back to the kitchen even before I had the opportunity to complain.  The manager stopped by and was so apologetic and gave us a gift card to come back.  Even though I would probably never order the steak again, we will definitely be back for the ambience, the drinks, the other yummy food, but most of all for the EXCELLENT customer service that is so rare to find these days.

QzH5dmXI5VY5i-mXCZ6Rzw,"I came here on a saturday night for dinner to celebrate my 25th birthday with the best of company, fun entertainment, and delicious food!!! I'd been here before but always sat in the front of the restaurant... had NO clue how HUGE this place was!!! We sat in the very back (where it seems many of the large birthday parties were seated) The ambiance of the restaurant is very dark and jungle esque (if i remember correctly o.o) lol very ruckusy and vegas appropriate! There were drummers and scandalous (but h0t) dancers going up and down the aisles which provided for the fun entertainment.  But enough of that, on to the main event. 

We had a party of 6 and decided it best to do as our super nice server suggested, omakase style :) 
- Cucumber cocktail on the house!!! They brought each of us a mini cocktail to start the meal off! Very nice and considerate of them! nice and refreshing and definitely got my appetite going :) 
- A trio appetizer platter consisting of well salted edamame, roasted shito peppers, and deep fried string beans served in the most delicious chipotle aoli sauce (all 3 were delicious but I think my favorite would have to be the roasted shito peppers with a drizzle of lime juice for a nice kick)
- Yellowtail Sashimi MINI TACOS!!! These were sooo fun and delicious! Great fushion idea! The restaurant is VERY accommodating, we mentioned to them 1 of the girls is allergic to cilantro so they brought out a special lobster taco for just for her! The flavors were bold and the taco shell was nice and crispy.  But I think I still enjoy DOS CAMINO'S mini tacos better...those are to.die.for.  
- Ahi tuna over a piece of bamboo and basil leaf.  This was an interesting combination.  Probably my least favorite dish of the night.  The basil leaf was a bit overwhelming and covered the taste of the ahi too much. 
- Filet Mignon with oversized asparagus.  The meat was tender and very well cooked, very pink in the middle.  I'm not a big beef eater so I only ate the edges of the piece but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  Definitely not one of the top dishes of the night but was still yummy.  The ASPARAGUS however, was QUITE delicious!! they probably cooked it in butter... hahaha i'll take it :) A good bite on the outside and nice and tender on the inside! 
- Sea Bass with oversized Peruvian corn!!! YUMMMY!!!! The sea bass was nice and flaky.  Flavoring was a bit salty but I feel like at these restaurants they tend to do that a bit...i mean, everyones a bit intoxicated so salty foods are what people want LOL The peruvian corn was just really fun to eat!! My friends really enjoyed it but I definitely like summer sweet white corn on the cob better :) 
- MUSHROOM POT ON CRACK. THIS WAS DEFINITELY THE SHOW STOPPER OF THE NIGHT!!! the flavoring of the sauce, the textures of the 3? 4? different mushrooms. happiness. The sauce was like a cream of mushroom, milky, full flavored, salty, a hint of sweetness... too good. needless to say we all took a bite and just smiled in satisfaction. We all stared at each other and knew rice was needed to soak up all that bomb sauce!! 
- 4 different Sushi Rolls were brought out last (3.5 stars).  All 4 were decent, nothing really to rave much about unfortunately. :(  I'm a big big sushi lover and have had some off the chart rolls so I can't pretend these were anything to die for.  

***The first time I came my friend ordered for the table and I definitely think that made a difference.  They have some REALLY scrumptious dishes that I wish I could've ordered for my friends to try!! Perhaps next time!! I'll be more prepared lol 

OVERALL RATINGS:
Food - 3.75 stars (except for the mushroom pot on crack... 4.5 stars for that)
Food (for the first time I came) - 4.25 stars! 
Drink - 4 stars for the cucumber cocktail & bottle of Santa Margaritta Pino Grigio
Presentation - 4 stars
Service & Ambiance - 4 stars

I gave this place 4 stars mainly because I had a great time that night, and the company I kept definitely played a big part in that.  The food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  Its definitely a GREAT place to go with a group thats just looking for some good eats, good drinks, and a great time :O) BOTTOM LINE: I'd DEFINITELY GO BACK AGAIN!!",4.0
wjtpC1_-RNPyOnrQQ62lDg,"4 stars means I'm a fan, and yes Id agree with that. However what is putting them from a solid 3 to a 4 is the value and service. Seriously, a chopped or caesar salad for 3.95? 5-7pm Happy Hour that includes half off starters, pizzas, and glasses of wine, wow, for real! 

So with that being said we had a great time at Marcella's, yes folks a chain, but a decent chain with only a few locations in Ohio. The straight forward menu makes for easy navigation and the helpful suggestive service was more than enough to make decisions easy. 

Okay, we kinda freaked out when  we heard the half off starts and pizzas.. we ordered way to much but was so worth it. 

Started with the meaty Sicilian pizza, topped with Capacola, Salami, Meatballs, Asiago Cheese, Red Onion, which was probably my favorite. The crust was thin and crunchy and all of the flavors of the meats and cheese really were balanced so I could taste each with one bite after the next.

Beef Carpaccio was a close runner up with its thinly shaved rare beef, toasted capers and wild arugula. The flavors were bright thanks in part to the lemon aioli.

The Braised Veal Meatball was so light and tender I wanted to order another as my entree rather than the Gnocchi con Bolognese . The problem with the gnocchi was the gnocchi themselves. Kind of like eating raw biscuit dough, but the lamb bolognese was simple and delicious. 

The Chicken Parmesan was served how I like to eat with both alfredo & tomato sauce. My only wish is that it had just a bit more sauce so I could use the house ciabatta to sop up the extra. 

Desserts are kept simple like the rest of the menu so we shared with Cherry Crustada. The crust was light and flaky, the cherries filling slightly tart and the ice cream rich and creamy, *pant pant* yum!

This was certainly a pleasant experience with a welcoming laid back feel, generous portions and affordable pricing. Oh yes, they also use Opentable.com for free online reservations, so yes, I'm definitely a fan!!!",4.0
cSkzuxDxW87T5ojzedITaA,"I have purchased two carpets here and went for my third today. The first two worked out just fine. You save a little money by having very limited customer service but it has good variety as long as you are good with looking on your own. 

Today we found a carpet we wanted and asked the sales guy to come over to price it out. It is an 8x10 and he gave the price, we agreed and then he went to write us up. When we went to pay, I noticed the price was different that the quote from 10 minutes ago by about $40. He said I needed to buy 8x12 instead because they don't have a use for the other 2"". Well, neither do I, this was not in the agreed upon price and it is a remnant so they can cut however they want. 

The bottom line here is that they were not honest and did not honor the direct quote given. Most of all, it feels like they are taking advantage of people by giving a price and then changing it without telling you. 

Good carpet variety but a lack of integrity and honesty. Maybe it is a new guy but the owner didn't help. Be careful that the price they give is the same when you pay the bill.",2.0

My personal favorite places are hole in the wall joints so walking into this restaurant definitely provided that vibe. Miss Dee, the owner I believe, was one of the nicest owners I have met at a restaurant. She immediately came out of the kitchen and personally greeted us with amazing hospitality. She gave us the low down of her spot answering any questions about the food we had. Now onto the meat and potatoes, literally! Three of us got a large loaded potato, each topped with different meats. One had the beef brisket, the other had pulled pork, and I got the buffalo chicken. Don't expect your food to come out in a minute like it was just microwaved. Everything was freshly put together and it was beyond worth it! Each meat was cooked to perfection with amazing flavors throughout the potato. Combine that with melted cheese, sour cream, and other delicious toppings, this potato can't be beat!

I'm so glad I called Diane and after talking to her on the phone I felt confident that she was the one who would take over caring for my little ones.

TLtehTkEN271rINcsyjk5Q,"I honestly didn't find this place to be all that.  Don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but I can find better made items that Honey Salt offers for way cheaper price.  The only good thing that I was blown away by is their Fried Calamari.  That was a pretty legit dish.  Their biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich I believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  We also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap ""free range"" chicken breast that was grilled.  Overall not too impressed with what they served.  And this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  Everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.  

Again, overall the place is well lit and looks great.

miNlxoNM15-lH7KE5fwDgQ,"Remember 98 South Wine Bar?... or the 2nd 98 South Wine Bar?... or Fat Cat?  That space in Downtown Chandler has a new tenant, and they seem like a keeper.  DC Steak House is a rarity in Phoenix; a mid-priced, independent steak houses in a sea of chain restaurants and a la carte wallet busters.

Looks:  Well, it does look fairly similar to the previous restaurants, except they changed the bar area and the art.  I like it.  It's elegant and not too dark or too partitioned.  There's a mural on one wall that I think the owner painted.  The place is a nice addition to Downtown, which is still fighting off the urban sprawl of mega-chains.

Crowd:  Seemed happening, although it was Opening Night.  A wide mix of young and old.

Food:  My eye was drawn to the large selection of fish, but I decided to go with steak at a steak house.  The salad was solid.  I especially liked the Italian dressing with a little Feta cheese in it.  Bread was OK.  My steak was great, tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked.  Served with a (undercooked) baked potato, and sauteed mushrooms.  My friend ordered the walleye.  I was a big fan, but he said it was a little bland compared to what he catches in Minnesota.  Maybe that was a fish story.

Value:  Here's where I thought this place shined.  Meals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  They have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri/Sat until after 9pm.  Seems fair.

Service:  Service was slow, although it was Opening Night.  They also screwed up my friend's appetizer, serving him the wrong kind of wing sauce.  However, the people could not have been nicer.  The owner apologized and bought us desserts.  (Chocolate Decadence Cake was delicious, although a little rich for my taste.)  Then, the chef came out , shook our hands, and bought us drinks.  I felt like I was in a place where people would remember my name, even though they surely won't.

Miscellaneous:  A lot of decisions haven't been made yet.  Will they serve lunch?  What will they do for happy hour? (a crucial decision in my mind.)  Even the menu will likely vary in the coming months.

Verdict:  I don't go out for steaks often, even reasonably priced ones, but I'll definitely be back to DC Steakhouse to see my new ""friends.""  I've got my eye on the steak sandwich for next time.",4.0

Sherrie was the girl that always did my laser and it was comfortable to be around. As my six treatments went up, I signed up and made a new package, and then soon again, those six were up, and I signed up again. THIS TIME THOUGH, I spoke to Monica before I signed anything. I wanted to make sure I would get a refund for any treatments if Sherrie was to leave or if they were to move locations because I was well aware that their policies are not very consumer-friendly. Well, guess what? They moved locations and nobody told me and my appt. had been cancelled. I called Neos to see what the deal was and Brian was super rude and said he would never agree to a refund, even though it is written in my chart. He said he can ""make it worth my while"" to drive all the way to another office which is 45 minutes from my house when I was only driving 20 to Peoria. He offered me a free microderm... I'm 20 and I told him I don't want one and he said that he would suggest it since my face needs a ""detailing"".... If that isn't rude I don't know what is. It gets better because he told me his tech Charlene is great and that she is BETTER then Sherrie and has a lot more experience. I did not think that it was professional to talk trash about former employees... especially when I have done so many  treatments with them. I have requested my chart to be faxed to me and nobody has gotten back to me. I had two treatments left and he wouldn't refund those treatments, even though I have been a loyal customer for so long.

3Gh-BxQK-jZnWG6alGoiUA,"This was my first visit to Top Golf, and I brought two family members visiting for the holidays.  The overall concept is quite fun - as an activity alone, we would rate this 5 stars - it is REALLY fun and something you can imagine yourself doing over and over as a social event.  Why two stars, you ask?

There are major issues with this place that test your patience.  First off, when you walk in, its total pandemonium (we came here at 3pm on Friday).  There are two line queue's but no signage or help as to what the lines are for, or where to even stand in line.  As it turns out, the first line is the ""membership line"" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  

The second line, is to ""check in"" - by which they scan your new membership card and ask whether you want a bay on a specific floor.  

Both of those tasks sound SO easy - and they should be - yet we still waited in line for about 40 minutes to accomplish these two tasks.  The entire time, we and everyone else in line are talking about how inefficient this place is and you would think the managers would see this once, and rearrange things to make it easier.  After all, we really wanted a beer - we could have been through two rounds at the bar in the same amount of  time we spent waiting around to check in.  

After all that, we still went to the bar and had two rounds while we waited.  Good selection of beer, bartenders were fast to see that we wanted booze and wasted no time in getting it.  

Then, we get our text message - our bay is ready, requiring us to go muscle into the line and tell the check in staff we are ready (which then irritates everyone in line because you are obviously butting in), but thats the way they like it here I guess.  

We head to our bay with a ""bay concierge"" that gives us the down low on the mechanics of play.  Its not the most intuitive thing in the world, but it works.  

We start hitting balls and our waiter shows up.  He literally walks us through the entire menu, page by page, explaining burgers, and appetizers, and frozen margaritas like we had never been to a pub before and didn't know what a ""slider"" was.  (Mind you, you pay by the hour at this place, so someone taking your time is quite annoying).  We order a bucket of beer and chips and guac, and shoo him off and get back to our golf.  Beers arrive, chips arrive - and our waiter arrives..... and stays.... and gets all chatty about football and where my family is from, and his Grandma in Colorado, and what it was like working after Christmas, and all sorts of topics that none of us care to talk about.  ugh, leave us alone - we are here for golf and beer, not a new pal.

When the chips came out, one in my party leaned over to the server and said, ""do you know one thing thats missing in this place?""  The server leaned in all interested.... ""napkins - there are no napkins on the table"".  Our server launched into a story about why there are no napkins - another server spilled a huge tray of soda into a bussing cart and that knocked over someones golf bag, and on and on and on..... and no napkins.  He stopped talking and stared at us - and we asked him, ""could we have napkins?"" - and there was this 'oh yeah' moment - he was oblivious at times.

So, we shoo waiter off to get another bucket of beer and a refill of chips, and he comes back with the beer, and no chips (and again, all chatty - does this guy have other tables?).  The refill of chips took about 20 minutes.  We came at an odd time, and we were expected home for dinner, but the burgers and sandwiches on other tables looked very good.

The kicker though, was that near the end of our session, our new buddy server out of the blue told us that the day after Christmas, there was a five hour wait, and they ran out of food, and booze, and kegs, etc.  He told us that they were going to get a lot of negative reviews for that on an email service card that is sent to you the next day after playing.  He asked us if we wouldn't mind marking everything 5 stars because they really needed the good marks, and he would buy us desert if we said yes.  

OK, this is the business guy in me coming out now, but the whole reason for getting feedback from your customers is to IMPROVE and figure out where you are failing.  The fact that you have a 40 minute check in process, or that you ran out of beer one night, or that there are no napkins on the table, or that there seems to be tons of staff walking around but not helping the bottlenecks - these are ALL issues that management needs to be aware of - but instead, they try to bribe you so that you will rate them the way they want to be rated.  If I owned this place, I would be PISSED off.   

Again, its a really fun concept, but it will try on your nerves big time.",2.0

eQYh6Q4FXgNBd9fvtnVC1A,"Their web site lured me in, impressive as it is... ""Largest service fleet in the area... etc. etc."" 

They said they could fix our LG washer, but then they didn't stock the parts, had to special order them, and when the new parts were installed, the machine didn't work.

Well, they get ZERO stars for not fixing the washer. They get ZERO stars for charging us for a service call when they had no real solution. They were kind enough to remove the new (bad? wrong?) parts, and to refund our money for them. 

But then, THEY GAVE UP, blaming LG for being a crappy company, and suggesting we buy a Whirlpool. Well, maybe that's true, and probably a good suggestion, although this $900 washer was highly recommended by Consumer Reports about five years ago, when we bought it. You would think if they are authorized to repair LG washers, that they would do a better job at customer service. 

Now I have to call LG, file a complaint, and find a *real* solution provider. This is a real *hassle* I don't need right now. 

Whatever happened to the old, ""We'll get it right, or you don't pay a dime!"" guarantee? Does anyone still offer that in the Appliance Repair category?

My father in law passed away late Friday, June 2nd. We went to the funeral home at 12 noon Saturday June 3rd to make arrangements for his visitation, funeral and graveside service. We left after 2pm and went to another florist in the area that was a friend of the family. No offense to that florist, her selections were slim pickings and she didn't seem too accommodating since she was low on fresh cut flowers because of ""prom weekend"". My wife was so upset because she wanted the perfect flower arrangement for her ""daddy"".

We began calling to realize that florist shut down and close shop early on Saturdays. I also know that sometimes a shop owner will still be around working, even though the shop is closed. I called Talley's and left a message... it was a shot in the dark. My wife didn't want to wait until Monday to figure this out when the visitation was scheduled for that evening. 

After about 20 minutes of giving up, my phone rang... it was Amy! She took the time to talk with us outside of business hours. She was sympathetic and compassionate towards us and our circumstances. We trusted her expertise and experience to provide us with an beautiful flower/plant combination.

We arrived to the funeral home Monday evening and looked for the flower/plant arrangement. WOW! It was so beautiful! My wife started crying. It was exactly why she wanted.

Amy went above and beyond for us. Her expert knowledge combined with taking the time to listen to us to understand our wishes produced an amazing arrangement. She is an example of what your floral experience should be. We would recommend Amy and Talleys Florist with full knowledge of how she interacts with actual customers.",5.0

This casino is about a 15-20 minute drive from the strip.

We were immediately greeted with the large screens in preparation for the Super Bowl.  They even had the volume turned up so that people in the area could listen.  They also had some TV's over the blackjack tables which was where we spent the second half watching the game. 

There's also an aquarium and aquarium-themed restaurant in which they have a [fake] mermaid swimming in the aquarium and then people can take pictures with her afterwards.  There were TV's in the restaurant showing the Super Bowl as well.

And If you sign up for a players card, you get a free buffet (which we didn't take advantage of, though).

S5GJKEGXAKtFrYaQC8Fuqw,"This little gem opened up a few month ago and it is run by the same people that have owned the Amena Cafe on Sahara near O'Bannon St. We started with the hummus ""tapas"" (their tapas are not the Spanish variety of small servings of various culinary concoctions but dippings for pita bread which can be ordered as whole wheat or regular). The pita was nice and warm and the hummus rich and flavorful. The Open Face Eggplant was huge mound of food with many different tastes and could have used a touch more tahini (on the side would have been better) but was freshly made and very good. There was more than enough for two meals. I had never had Shawarma before so I order the chicken and beef in the Combo Special. The chicken was spicy and the ""Halal"" beef was tender and spiced perfectly. The only thing one might want to know is that if you are not into spicy foods tell the staff and the chef will back off on the spices. This is important if you have children or people who don't normally eat spicy foods.  If this is not a concern then have at their offers freely.  The dessert was magnificent...an order of Bakalava was heavenly and the Kunaffe with goat cheese was out-of-this world!!  We had more than enough to take home for another meal.

We ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80). The Malaysian Curry was delicious but really, really oily (you could literally see the pools of oil gathering on top of the bowl). If you're fine with that (which I was), you'll probably still enjoy it. The sandwich was our highlight - it really filling but still super light and tasty (the bread was white toast, crispy and buttered). It was stuffed with everything it promised, but it didn't make you feel gross afterwards. With the tea, it was a great, comforting Saturday morning meal!

But back to my review...so I came at 12:30 with my boyfriend and we promptly ordered a caesar, a bellini, an order of donuts, the duck scramble, and the two egg breakfast. Yes, we're fatsos at heart. 

The drinks came in a timely manner, as did the donuts. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. AND WAITED. We are by no means slow eaters and we didn't stick around for very long after finishing our food, but we didn't leave this restaurant until close to 3pm! It was quite absurd how long our main dishes took to arrive. Definitely unimpressed with the service. 

As for the food itself, I'd call it 'decent'. The donuts were delicious, but the chocolate mousse-like dip it came with was rather tasteless. Actually, I actively didn't like the chocolate dip and I LOVE chocolate. My duck scramble was good but nothing special. I loved the potatoes, but everything else just...normal. 

Honestly, the best part about this place, in my opinion, is that it takes brunch reservations. I like the decor inside and it's apparently a very popular drink spot, but I probably won't be back for brunch unless all I want is an order of potatoes and a bellini.",3.0

We walked in around 6:30pm on a Friday night,  the restaurant was about half filled. There were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door.  We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  We politely ask if we could move to the front.  The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .  
We were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  It is a sweet butter with orange zest.  
We were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side.   The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom). 
I was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all.  
On the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good!

Torres I found out I was pregnant in July  but ended up  having a miscarriage in September . few appointments that I had with him he was very cold shouldered and I didn't feel he was really listening to what I had to say about my pregnancy that far. apparently after my 1st blood tests my estrogen was low so he prescribed me Progesterone 100 milligrams once a day. things didn't work out so come end of September I ended up scheduling a D&C. at that appointment he expressed that I probably have an estrogen issue since this was my 2nd miscarriage. He didn't know that by now????? smh...already frustrated with this location & this doc I was told I had to get went a follow-up. I did & he didn't even check me (didn't undress), he only asked me a few questions anything wrong, if I was trying to get pregnant again right away, if I want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit. This doc didn't seem to care about my well being and didn't care enough to take better precautions with my blood results. oh & while he was asking me questions before my surgery he answered a personal call in front of me...he was talking about his hurt hip, a trip aka vacation, that he feels better now & he got rest... then slowly walked out of my room. horrible!!! the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus.

8PV3gt3I8oOZj6gCeF6Sbw,"This is my favorite place to go for sushi, because of the ambiance, service, and overall quality of the menu items. 

The ambiance is welcoming (literally, with the chefs and servers acknowledging every patron's entrance with a warm greeting, as per Japanese tradition), and it never gets too busy or over-crowded, so there's no reason to awkwardly wait around ever. It's a good place for a first date, not only because sushi's romantic like that, but because it's never too startlingly quiet or loud. There's just enough going on in this restaurant to keep everyone interested without being obnoxiously distracting.

Since the space isn't very large, there's usually only one server on duty, but they always somehow manage to be attentive to all tables. One thing out of the ordinary is that I've always had to ask for the bill, or pay directly at the cashier. If not, I could be waiting for hours before my server would offer to bring it over.

The fish is always fresh and inventive. My favorite is the sashimi salad. It's my all time favorite, the vinaigrette is a perfect tartness in contrast with thin strips of salmon, tuna, octopus, and mackerel. I could eat it forever. Other menu items are always cute and beautifully presented. There are even local nods to the Flames, with the 'Red Mile Roll,' and 'Red Hot Flames Rolls.'

A mainstay for meal options when I'm traveling, Fresh has fresh bowls, juices and more. Yes it might just be rice and steamed greens but their sauces enhance everything.  When I come for healthy vegan food, that's all I really want. I don't care for the vegetables to be made into unrecognizable too small, creative portions. With that being said, Fresh still has some interesting spins on their menus, most notably the quinoa onion rings which are out of this world!

qTytqg0Y7GcQpDt93FSIQw,"I swear if the serving size was more this place could be a easy 4 1/2 Stars. My husband and I along with our boys were in SC last weekend for scheduled maintenance on one of our SUV's and since the appointment was so early we rushed out without breakfast so of course the entire time in the waiting area we were searching for food. 
This place was bookmarked by me so we went to check it out after seeing the menu had Vegan options and our boys and I are Vegan. 
We arrived and Boy was this place busy, people standing outside waiting for tables and all. I went in to see how the list worked and there was a sheet of paper on the landing with no one manning it and several sets of people in the extremely small (6ppl capacity) entry way. I flagged down a server who then came to take my name and others waiting name down and explained to us all at once how the long table in the middle worked. Basically the table is 1st come 1st served and adding your name to the list put you on wait for the tables around the room on the outer perimeter. We were told 30min so we sat in the car and my husband went inside every 10mins to see if we were coming up since they don't take numbers nor do they have buzzers. I totally don't mind this process at all it seems more down to earth and not commercial. 
After about 40 plus minutes we got a table and were so hungry and I ordered the chef special vegan dish which was the only Vegan dish on the list. I was immediately told that the chef special was SOLD OUT and that happened about a half hour before I ordered (meaning if we had a seat I wouldn't got to have it ). Mind you it was only like 11:30am *insert Kanye shrug* 

I read on the specials menu that there was a skillet with lots of yummy veggies that I enjoy and some type of meat, I asked if the skillet could be made for me minus the meat. The waitress agreed so that's what I ordered. My husband ordered a veggie egg while omelet dish with a sweet potato waffle. Our toddler had pancakes and fruit. 

Look I'm honest so here is the run down on what you we had:

Skillet (cauliflower, squash, sweet potato & red peppers) - This  we super tasty but extremely small.
Egg white omelet with veggies(Goid)
Sweet potato waffle - Hubby wasn't impressed he stated it was to soft and the texture wasn't what he expected.

D3vieRpv7g5o0WYQqa6VoQ,"My husband and I drove by Rani's a couple weeks ago and he said, ""International Market? That looks interesting.""  So I made a note to check it out on Yelp later.  After reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, ""$6 vegetarian Indian food? I want to go to there!""

So that is how we wound up at Rani's.  I immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha (I'm a sucker for paneer), and the cute lil lady behind the counter proceeded to give me an Indian sweet to have while I waited.  She brought out our thali, which consisted of 2 roti, rice, dal, pickles, okra, an aloo-gobi-type yumminess, and I believe kofta (veggie dumplings).  The cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave us a tomato soup with paneer in it.  Definite bonus points.

Everything was fantastic, although I was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha.  This place is very casual, which I really like about it.  Don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit-down Indian restaurant; instead, expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen.

After we filled our bellies, we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery store.  I hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  Anything you would need for a well-stocked Indian pantry is here, and then some.    There's also mint and tamarind sauces, bottled lassis, naan, and huge blocks of paneer.  Trust me when I say I seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home.

I considered giving this place 4 stars, because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time.  But it was a Friday evening and there was an Indian soap opera on the TV I think we interrupted....So, obviously, I can't blame them.",5.0

Slq7ppnKQjwR-6LSYLNuzg,"I remember coming to the Buffet at the Bellagio several years ago for Sunday Champagne Brunch and being blown away.   It was one of the best brunches I had ever eaten.  Alas, my most recent trip did not make nearly as stellar an impression.  I brought my mother here for her birthday dinner last month, wanting to share with her the wondrous buffet I remembered.  

Well, we got off to a bad start.  My son fell asleep in the car on the way over (he's five and had been in the pool all day) and I carried him into the restaurant.  At the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  Because it was mom's birthday, I went with it, but I was annoyed.  No child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food. They want the pizza and dessert and not much else.  Of course he didn't want to wake up at all and refused to eat much of anything, so I paid for him to sit there and be cranky.  My bad.

As for the adult meals, the food was fine.  I had prime rib, which was only OK, but the mashed potatoes were awesome.  My mother had the crab legs which she loved.  We must have sampled every dessert they served and each one was better than the last.  The waitress was kind of lazy and had to be waved down to refill our water.  

Really the food was pretty good, so maybe it is just my son's behavior that's coloring my opinion on our meal,  but I just can't help but feel like we over paid.  There was nothing remarkable offered.  The service was iffy, the food was unexceptional.  Well, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.

DQbpZJQRMEDZcqbklqvOQw,"AWFUL AWFUL PEOPLE! I'm only giving them one star because I can't post otherwise, but they're not even worth that. I used MovingAPT.com to find them - won't ever use them again either. I thought having an agent would prevent this kind of crap from happening. I don't even know where to start with my complaints; this entire move was a mess from the beginning due to lack of communications and professionalism. I paid extra for a specific move date and time, as well as a 'special handling fee' because of my piano. 

When they arrive for the pick-up - 2 days late 6 hours after they were supposed to be there - they didn't come prepared for a piano. My dad and uncle had to find 2x4's to use as a ramp and help the movers hold it and roll it off the porch. This is a stage piano, the wheels aren't really meant for rolling around cement! After loading everything and telling my parents they were headed my way (Virginia), my stuff is taken from Wyoming to Seattle, then back to Vegas where it was put in storage without my knowledge or permission. I only found out because I kept calling to see the whereabouts of the truck so I could plan accordingly. After repeated phone calls, and finally the threat of legal action, my items were put back on a truck and started the journey East. 

Finally, they call to tell me they'll be there on June xx, which is exactly during the 3-day window I said I would be out of the state and not be able to receive the truck - again, all covered BEFORE the contract was even signed. So I'm told if I can't get a friend to meet them at my house and let them in, they'd go on to New York with my stuff and I'd have to pay an additional fee to get it, whenever they brought it back to me, which would be at their discretion. Luckily, I was able to get a hold of someone and coordinate with them to receive the shipment, upon which he started taking pictures the moment the truck was opened. (see below). After they had unloaded everything and AFTER I had confirmed 3 times over the course of this month that they had the proper equipment, they realize that in fact, they don't have anything to move the piano. So they decide they'll go to Home Depot, hire random men, and carry/lift the piano into my house. You don't LIFT a piano! So my friend that's there says no, it's too heavy, you need the proper equipment, I suggest you go find it. So then they tell him that they need to get on the road to New York for their next job so they'll just go put my piano in a warehouse until I was back so I'd let them deliver it. Again, they're told no, at which point the driver calls me while I'm in the airport and says if I don't let them into my house I'd have to pay a second delivery fee. I told them not to leave the state with my piano and I'd call them right back - so I call my friend and ask what's going on; he gives me the scoop. I asked him if he'd run up the street - about 4 blocks from my house - and secure a storage unit that these guys could back the truck right up to the ramp, get the piano on a dolly and store it there for two days til I could get a professional. He said OK, and while I'm still on the phone, I hear him say exactly that to the driver. I call the driver back myself and say the same thing. I literally asked them to wait 15 minutes while we got this taken care of; he said OK. My friend leaves, gets the paperwork for a storage unit, comes back and these guys have unloaded the piano, ROLLED it down the sidewalk (no dolly), tried to lift it up my 4 steps, DROPPED it, eventually go it inside, and we're RUNNING TO THEIR TRUCK when my friend gets back. They hadn't given him the inventory sheets or had him sign anything, so he hollers at them and runs after. He had to jump in his own vehicle to chase them down and cut them off before they stopped. At that point they gave him the paperwork - still not signed - and took off again. 

As soon as I got home that same evening I went right to the piano to take a look and started taking pictures. I called the driver and asked what had happened. He said nothing, everything was fine, no damage. I called BS and told him I'm standing in my living room looking at the damage. He hung up and I've never been able to get a hold of these people since.",1.0

Long line to get tickets meant standing outside in the sun.  No kiosks.  Screen, sound and chairs were good.  Way too hot.  I've never walked out of a theatre with swamp ass before.  10 mins of commercials prior to the ""start time"" followed by another 30 mins of previews.

FJcT1mTMl5dqg56vKA2A3Q,"Some notes: restaurant is located in the Esplandade with the AMC cinema and to the east of the Ritz Carleton.  Best bet is to park in the parking garage and then go to the walking mall.  Even so, it's tough to find.  Don't give up.  Also, it is no longer Fuego Tacos, but now Fuego del Mar, with a seafood-centric menu.  

That being said.  I was pretty edgy by the time we arrived.  We're from Cave Creek and had been out shopping and then had a heck of a time finding the place, so we arrived about 8.15---pretty close to closing.  And I had a Groupon---and there are Yelp reviews that said the staff DOESN'T like Groupon-ers.

Greeted by guy that I assume is the gent someone described as ""XL"".  He's just a little round.  And was a warm, welcoming fella.  He beamed a smile at us, waved at dining room and told us to sit wherever we wanted.  We chose a cozy booth in the corner.  Our server was there in moments with menus and take our drink orders.  I wish I remembered her name---dark hair in a pony-tail, glasses, and really personable and nice despite it being the end of the night and we were late-comers.  

Nice ambiance---exposed brick walls, soft light, great music---DH would have liked their playlist!

TROUBLE: she hands us the menu.  Except for one dish, everything is seafood.  Fuego Tacos is now Fuego del Mar.  DH doesn't like fish and is semi-allergic to shellfish.  I asked if he wanted to leave, and he said no, we had gone thru too much to find the place---he would just order the one non-seafood dish.  At least he didn't have to make a lot of choices!  So DH ordered the Pernil Asada, which was described as slow-cooked pork topped with mango-chile salsa.  His sides were the Green Chile-Bacon Hushpuppies and the Latin Succotash.  I ordered their signature dish of Seafood Chile Rellenos---a poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, crab and tilapia in a lobster-tomato sauce with hush puppies and Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw.  For drinks, DH got the house red and I got a Pomegranate Adult Lemonade.

Drinks arrived in less than 5 minutes.  DH very happy with something he thought would be bottom row plonk.  My Adult Lemonade was SO delicious---I had to be careful!  I could have drank several of them.  It tasted like lemonade with a hint of fruit---but it definitely had alcohol in it!

Entrees arrived within 15 minutes of the drinks.  DH's was all on one plate.  Three hush puppies, Latin Succotash---which looked delish---and a mound of pork with the salsa.  Not super pretty.  My presentation was much more beautiful---a mammoth poblano pepper in a puddle of light red sauce.  Slaw and hush puppies on the side.  Lovely presentation.  My only comment is that serving something in a bowl (albeit large) that needs to be cut is problematic.

I'd like to say how wonderful DH's meal was, but basically I got one bite of his pork---that's all he would share---before he devoured it.  He said it was one of the best pork dishes he had ever enjoyed.  He felt like he was in the Caribbean!  I got no bites of the Succotash, darn him---looked so good!  He scarfed it all!   His hush puppies went that fast too!

Was my seafood Chile Relleno the best thing EVER?  No, but it was VERY, VERY GOOD!  Beautifully cooked, not greasy,  seafood not overcooked at all, the lobster-tomato sauce was delicious.  Again, only quibble I have is serving it in a bowl.  It was a very deep bowl too---a smaller girl might have had trouble reaching in there, but I am fairly tall and long-armed.  The hush puppies---shut my mouth, darlin', but they were dang good!  Lots of lovely, bacon-y flavor, a hint of heat, and a touch sweet.  What is it with those Yankees not adding a bit of sweet to their cornbread?  Whoever made these knew what they were doing.  The Pineapple-Serrano Cole Slaw was in a citrus-y, non-creamy dressing and the crispness, the fruitiness and the heat was a perfect counterpoint to the richness of the Relleno.

Huge portion---I ended up bringing home half the Relleno, Slaw and two hush puppies---LUNCH!  YUM!  DH swined his plate so it's deli turkey for him, hahaha!

Bonus---ended up talking to the gentleman in the booth next to us---so interesting.  He is a musician who's lived all over the US and the world---Europe and the Middle East.  Really neat guy.  I wouldn't live in the City, but I love visiting the City 'cause you meet the most interesting people!

So at the end, I pulled out my Groupon and gave it to our server, apologizing that I had ""hid"" it until the end, but that Yelp reviews had indicated Groupon-ers got short shift as far as service went.  She took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  Not nice.  (BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25)

03_9Pt4J7-jqjXdJah35kg,"I took my daughter to see Dr Lederman in the Glendale office as she was needing a shoulder replacement. I was told he is the best. My daughter has multiple disabilities from a TBI. She only has the use of that one arm/shoulder. Of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment. He said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery. He suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain. Then the next appointment with Dr Lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain, my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard. Shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain. Then she was prescribed with pain meds. This went on another few years. She was crying in pain everyday and in the night too. I massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution I could find besides taking the pain meds. She cried and  ""begged"" me to cut off her arm several times. We finally went back to Lederman again. This time my daughter refused to take no for an answer...she wanted the surgery. Dr Lederman left the room and came back in saying ""I'm not the man for job. Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI."" Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one. My daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it. He did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart.

zU3oPhDmsOhIcfIXjaAdwQ,"Came here with a group of 20+ to see Morgan Page on 11/30/12.

Arrival: Got to the club around 11pm. Getting to the club was simple, took only around 15 minutes from the car to the lines (and that included a bit of pre-gaming)! 

Entry: Got my entire group on a guestlist with a 1:1 (guy/girl) comp until midnight. Sign up on their website and you will get a text back if you have been put on. The entry line was confusing as hell, with at least 4 different lines (staff, promoter, general, VIP). There was an open bar for ladies from 11-12 so things were a bit rushed. This came back to bite me in the ass as I made the mistake of leaving my guestlist line for the shorter staff entry line. Members of my group were with this female staff member who said could get us all free in even though our guy:girl ratio had more guys. I spoke with her personally to make sure of it before I left my line. Well...SHE LIED! The bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry. My girlfriend was not pleased with the fact that one of my other group members (who came stag) got in for free and I didn't. Whatever, lesson learned. Don't rush in. Don't be tempted by an open bar or a shorter line. Stick with guestlist if you're approved. Make sure your group ratio is even or favors girls. Don't listen to otherwise!

Club Layout: The club itself is very nice. Not quite as grand or spacious as XS next door, but a beautiful venue nonetheless. Main dance floor is average sized. It was spacious enough so that we didn't feel like canned sardines and had adequate room to dance. There are no stairs or steps to climb, a la Marquee, so ladies will appreciate this. The main room is flanked by a large tent-like area and the outdoor wading pool/patio area. The easiest accessible restrooms are outside as well (the indoor one gets crowded). The outdoor area is ideal for those who want to socialize more, take pictures, take a breather, etc. It's beautiful.

Bar: The indoor bar layout is terrible. There was maybe 10 feet between the bar and the backs of the booths for those who got tables. This 10 feet also serves as the main walkway to get to the tent and outdoor area. Not so surprisingly, there is a lot of pushing, bouncers shining lights and telling you to move, and it worst of all: it takes forever to get a drink! I said before to not by tempted by an open bar for ladies and here's why: this is the only bar ladies can get free drinks from! On top of that, ladies can only get one drink at a time! So ladies, if you planned to be here for an hour and get drunk or pass drinks to the guys, you'll be disappointed.The outdoor bar nudged in between the tent/outdoor area is empty and stress-free compared to the one inside, so I would recommend buying drinks from here. Drinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.

Overall, I had a great experience at Surrender. The club was beautiful, my group had a blast, and Morgan Page (and his opener) rocked it! Learn from my mistake, stay away from the indoor bar, and come with great people and you will have one memorable night! 4/5.",4.0

Jq10w1aWcf0cxBw-caixkg,"It use to be that when I have my annual vacation to Vegas with either my girlfriends or husband, Koi was the place to go to get my sushi needs. 

Ever since I went to Social House, I certainly changed my mind about going to Koi again!  

My girl friend and I went to Social House last Saturday a little before 5, before the restaurant opened for dinner.  The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their ""Socialite"" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their ""lycheetini"".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have. 

When it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called ""hana awaka""....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new! 

The food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.  

Everyone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.   

The ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation.

g_-16KV8WRofocPT9QHAnw,"I want to start by saying that the staff there are all very friendly and knowledgeable, however I have not had a good experience there.

I have a chronic eye condition that requires me to get a hard contact lens for one eye. Typically I had to go to Oakland to get all this done and I wanted to see if I could find somewhere closer to home. I got new glasses, lenses and a new hard lens here.

First they lost the order for my eyeglasses. They never realized this until about a month after my visit and I called having not heard anything. When I got them the prescription was far too strong and they had to back it off. So getting my glasses took over two months.

For my hard lens it took time to get that correct as well, but that is expected. It also took me several times asking my Oakland optometrist to get my records faxed to them. McCauley-Celin at first said they never received them, but they then found them in another computer system. When the first lens didn't fit quite right I went to the Wexford office to get it checked and left my lens there as it needed to be returned. When my new lens came they asked for my old one and apparently it was lost out there or somewhere. I paid for my lens with my FSA account but then was told that it should be covered under my insurance and that they would take care of it. That didn't happen so I called to ask about it. They never got back to me so I went to their Gibsonia office and they said that they owed me money and it was fixed. This all again took several months.


If you just need glasses and lenses and are fairly routine in your needs, you'll probably be fine. But I'm going back to Oakland I guess. The office staff just can't handle anything.",2.0

It also gives you a bar so you can just sit at and enjoy drinks that have been made by the bartender. It offers a variety of food. From entrees like burgers, steak, and fish, and if you are not feeling to hungry then they have appetizers like hot wings, sliders, chips and salsa and so many more options. Also they allow you to order your food from home and pick it up and take it home. I personally like that there is so many options to choose from on the menu. I like how they also cater to the needs of someone trying to be healthy and watch their diet by adding healthy items to the menu. The staff is great and helpful. They don't hang around, and watch you eat. They check in at appropriate times to refill your drinks and ask how you're doing. The only thing I dislike is the waiting time. I usually have to wait 30 minutes to be seated. But that is because I usually go on the weekends, so it is understandable. I would give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars.",4.0

ms2vpymhegH4-_VkL5myEw,"7/15/17. Came to Vegas to celebrate a milestone birthday - and Saturday just seemed to want us to be at Encore Beach Club the entire day/night. First, we attended Diplo, with some promoter price tickets for the guys and the ladies on a free list. Came around 11 to avoid the line - easy-peasy. We ate there, while letting the sunscreen dry, then spent the whole afternoon dancing and splashing. The staff was great, the people as well-  there was hard partying but no fights or any such ratchetness, just people from all over having the time of our lives. The rave-booty was twerk-tacular. There were spankings. The bartenders seemed to be having more fun than the people drinking. All I saw were smiles. You could see Diplo from any of the pools, except perhaps the front middle as people stand and dance in front of the DJ. We danced with our group of 8 (4 couples) and met plenty of nice people. 

As more of my group came in from all over, we came back for Marshmello Saturday night (Nightswim!), whom I hadn't seen since EDC last year. We got a great table on a lily-pad off the pool (not on the pool) just in case there was gratuitous splashing, we'd want a dry drinking spot haha. Our view was fantastic, table was perfect, the VIP even invited us into the small VIP pool behind us. 

We got a great package that started with 2 magnums of grey goose, which did great for our group. I was impressed how they handled both my large group (12 on table, 14 total that night) and the speed-bump of my credit-card declining as I forgot to tell the bank I was leaving the state. My Host Alexia, beholder of a supernatural beauty, waited patiently and kindly while I called the card and had them over-ride the security hold. She was calm and pleasant, and simply said ""this happens all the time."" (This was in stark contrast to the treatment at Omnia the night before where the bartender threatened to have my friend arrested when his card declined). 

Alexia and her runner, damn I totally forgot his name (even he was a really nice guy), treated us incredibly well. She came back and poured drinks throughout the night, not just the obligatory first round. They also made sure we stayed hydrated! Super important when it's 100 at night. They gave us just the right amount of attention and class. 

Thank you guys, and special thanks to Alvin for the rockstar treatment at the door. Saturday night was the cherry on top of my birthday weekend!! Truly I don't expect anything less from Encore/Wynn (XS, Surrender/Encore Beach Club) - I never get anything less than the best experience there, over the span of years that I have both attended with tickets and tables.

2kld_rZ4dv8-UoKIlmcnmQ,"This is my go-to grocery store when I am too lazy to head to Winco. I have been here well over a hundred times, and the experience is pretty standard for Smith's stores in my experience.

I have never had a problem with stocking here, which is good. Items are always stocked well, regardless of when in the week you come. I am not the biggest fan of their produce however. About 20% of the time, I bring how green beans or asparagus, and two days later they are covered in mold (and no, it is not my refrigerator). So I no longer purchase produce here except for when I am in a bind. Store is also always clean, I have never once seen a spill or poorly arranged merchandise, which is a testament to the hard working staff. 

The staff are always very helpful and friendly. They don't always have enough baggers, but last time I was there they had plenty, and wouldn't even let me unload my cart (they had a separate person in the aisle that unloaded people's carts for them). First time I've experienced that and it was pretty great. 

Prices are a bit on the high side overall, I would not shop here if you do not use your Smith's card. The prices are outrageous with out it. However, they end up being pretty reasonable when you remember to use the gas points (which is now made easier by the Smith's gas station located directly in front of this store). 

They DEFINITELY need way more cart corrals in the parking lot. Like at least double the amount they currently have. There are none closer to the gas station, and when the store is busy people are too lazy to walk their carts back to the corrals, and I've seen carts fly into parked cars on at least three separate occasions. I hope Smith's management reads this review and fixes this problem soon.",4.0

DMdqVhEEzd4hU9nV_YOKWg,"Nestled in what is (for now) a relatively sleepy corner of Downtown, Urban Bodega (aka URBO) feels like something of a throwback to some of the small convenience stores I used to see line the Roosevelt Row neighborhood.  Back when Downtown was still a neighborhood where only the most diehard entrepreneurs dared to tread, you could find one of these small neighborhood shops selling everything from wine and beer, to snacks, to cooking essentials, and even a few household cleaning items.  The relatively new Pure Fillmore apartment complex is currently the first of what will undoubtedly be many new apartment and condo complexes lining 7th Avenue in Downtown.  But for now, the nearest full sized grocery store requires a car.  All the more reason URBO's location makes sense.

You'll find URBO on the bottom floor of the Pure Fillmore Apartments on Fillmore Street just east of 7th Avenue.  The brainchild of DeSoto Central Market alum Shawn Connelly, you enter here through the front patio area (where there's seating for eight by the way).  Inside, its a whole lot of stuff mixed into a small space.  Behind the counter, you can get coffee, tea, or even a sandwich made on the spot.  In front of the counter, it's essentially a small independent convenience store with many of the things you'd expect.  Candy bars, meds, condiments, snacks, microwavable items, beer, wine, soda, as well as odds and ends like tissue paper, shampoo, and storage bags.  I can well imagine some Downtown college students living in the apartments upstairs too hung over or too tired to drive two miles to Safeway and instead opting for a stop here.

For my first stop here on a Saturday morning, I opted to get a quick morning pick me up.  A tea and a sandwich.  I got their Salted Caramel Iced Tea (also available hot) and their Turkey Sausage Egg & Cheese sandwich on an english muffin.  Both made to order.  Total cost including tax: $10.  Now to be fair, they prepared the sandwich in part using a microwave so we're not talking gourmet here.  Still, the sandwich hit the spot and the sausage in particular was very tasty.  I was also very happy with the tea.  Almost tasted like a southern style sweet tea of sorts with those caramel accents.  A solid breakfast.

So there you have it.  A locally owned business filling a need in an emerging neighborhood.  Nothing pretentious.  Just a good, straight forward, progressive independent convenience store.  Even if you don't live in this quiet corner of Downtown, its worth a look.  Or a sip and bite and it was in my case.",4.0

I had some minor issues with it, first being that there was just a little too much aioli on the bread and second that the fried tomato was a red tomato and not a green tomato. I just found the texture of the tomato unappetizing. I also enjoyed their bloody mary and they have a nice local, craft beer selection.

I can say nothing but positive things about my experience at fitness together Steele creek. The facility is clean and well equipped and the staff is knowledgeable and full of personality. When my wife and I first showed up, we had a deal to try five sessions for 99 dollars. We had talked for a while about joining a gym, but fitness together is so much more. It's like a community of people working toward a common goal of getting fit and taking control of their health. The owner, Joe, is very knowledgeable in fitness, exercise, and most importantly nutrition. He worked with us to set up individual  nutrition plans and exercise programs to help us attain our goals. Included with your sessions purchase is a fitness assessment which measures body fat percentage, fitness levels, resting heart rate, flexibility, and a few other factors. Additional assessments are given throughout your tenure as a fitness together member so you can watch your total body transformation. It is a very encouraging atmosphere no matter your current level of fitness. At first I dreaded going to exercise, but after seeing the positive changes you just can't wait to get back. I like the fact that sessions can be purchased in packages without a long term commitment, but I must say I continue to add additional sessions. This is mainly because I continue to see results. My wife and I are both stronger, healthier, and happier thanks to Joe and his knowledgeable and helpful staff.

The food was very good and the drinks were fantastic but more importantly the service was outstanding.

We all started with cocktails - Margaritas and Mojitos.  The Margarita was made with bourbon and rimed with crushed bacon and salt (yes I said bacon).  The Mojitos were fresh and minty.  The one thing I we all really like about the drinks was that they were not too sweet.  

We ordered two apps for the table - Lobster Fritters and Braised beef short rib poutine.  OMG the poutine was out of this world!!  The fritters were good but there was no lobster flavor.  I think next time I would just order the vegetable fritters.

For mains we had fried fish tacos, steak burrito, jambalaya and grilled pork chop with red potato salad.  The jambalaya and the pork chop were features. The burritos was very nice.  The steak was a nice medium rare and it came with guacamole and lime crema.  Fish Tacos were delish!  The corn tortillas really make a difference.  The pork chop feature was really good.  My friend found it to be a little fatty but for those of us who love pork fat it was perfect.  The only dish that fell short was the Jambalya.  The sausage in the dish had great flavor but the overall dish didn't seem to come together.  

You would think by now we would be full but we sucked it up and ordered dessert. Two sweet potato pies, beignets and a Patron creme brulee.  My word it was good. The sweet potato pie was more of a bread pudding with a bourbon carmel sauce.  The creme brulee was one of the best I've had - it had a lovely fresh citrus flavor.  The beignets were tougher than I expected but still good.

I would like to point something out about this place.  No the food isn't cheap but the quality of the ingredients justifies the cost.  Our meal with tax and tip was $200 (for four).  The food was really good but what sets them apart is the service.  The restuarant was fairly busy and there was only one waiter who had the assitance of the owners Amy and Albert.  Yes there were times when we seemed to be waiting awhile for things but they made sure that we never felt forgotton.  They went out of their way to talk to us and make us feel welcome.  I've been to some really nice restaurants and had some incredible food but I've never been made to feel as welcome as did at The Combine Eatery.",5.0

DGBYjQt0PhqOmjM53eqtJA,"We arrived here at 10:00am and weren't able to get a full tour until 1:00pm, so we opted for the mini tour.

It was very informative and interesting. It starts with a brief video about the dam which lasts about 10 minutes. Then you are led to a line where you wait for your tour to begin. The take you down the elevator into the depths of the dam. You get to see all the workings and information about how it was built. The our guides are entertaining as well- as dam entertaining as you can be about a dam tour. LOL

After the tour concludes you are allowed to walk outside and see the dam from a great viewpoint. Awesome time to take pictures and really enjoy the massive beauty of this place. There is also a small exhibit inside which tells you more about how Hoover Dam was built and what it took. It is so amazing that people built this place so long ago and the horrendous conditions they had to endure. just standing outside in late July- temperatures topped 106 but in the sun it felt like 120.

Once you are done exploring the inside exhibits and views, you can wander outside and walk the dam. Beware that when you leave the dam touring area, you cannot return, it is a one way only exit. 

I recommend bringing lots of waters and hats, as the heat made exploring the dam outside almost unbearable.

After checking the outside of the dam, we walked over to little souvenir shop and bought some items. By that time, we were hot and starved, so we stopped at the small deli/snack shop at the dam and snagged a table to eat lunch. Beware it can get very crowded. We ordered a small deli sandwich and some chicken tenders/fries for the kids.

TIP: Bring your own bagged lunch and sit on the shaded areas/benches during your walk of the dam to really enjoy the experience. There is a Subway on your drive in to stop at.

This was a memorable, amazing visit and is one of those places you see that you will remember forever.",5.0

Yet, over time, Petal has begun to bring in a more varied selection that appeals to a wider, stylish market. While they still offer the $300-$450 cocktail dresses, they also showcase a variety of merchandise in the $75-$100 range. Plus, if you can catch them on a sale day, it's worth a trip.

Brand wise, you'll find upscale brands like Shoshanna, Amanda Uprichard, Alice & Trixie, Frock by Tracy Reese, James Jeans, Anlo and Citizens for Humanity.

Last month while I was in Las Vegas, I did a very quick trip just to watch my beloved Hawaii Warriors play football against UNLV.

While I was in Las Vegas, I decided to go up with just a duffle bag for my luggage, as I was basically away for just 2.5 days.

As a professional traveler, I like to travel light, and if I take something with me on a trip..........I'll be sure to use it! 
Don't you just hate it when you over-carry stuff & not use it? I've learned over the years from all my travels for work to ""travel efficiently"", and I hate carrying extra stuff.........because all you're doing is lugging excessive weight!

How does the Post Office come into play? 

Well, on my trip I decided to got to Trader Joe's (It's a Hawaii thing.........we don't have TJ in Hawaii).

But that's not it gang..........sure, I could have carried some of the stuff I bought home (which I did), but due to security, & TSA rules.........if you buy anything ""liquid"" or ""paste"" it cannot be over 3 oz. when you do any kind of carry on.

Catch my drift???

So after buying a few bottles of cookie butter for my sweetie (she likes that stuff), I realized I could not carry that onto the plane with me, so the next best thing to do.............yes gang! Go to the US Post Office, get one of them free - ""Flat Rate"" Boxes, load up all your junk that you bought (and make sure you pack it carefully if it's fragile), then tape it up.........and ship it out to yourself! In this case.........back to da 808!

Whaaaalaaaah! Not only was it cheaper to ship (even cheaper than paying for airline luggage, which usually runs from $25 to $35 dollars), but you don't have to carry it home either! What a smart Hawaiian I am 'eh!!!!! Lol!

So if you folks ever load up on omiyagi when you travel..............may I suggest this method to work around the dilemma you're in.

Just an FYI..........

Large Flat Rate Box cost only $17.90 to ship. If it fits........you can ship! 

Medium Flat Rate Box cost only $12.65 to ship. And again..........if it fits........you can ship!

This Post Office also has a automated kiosk, which is nice, because to can still ship items out when the post office is closed, or say you come here on a Sunday to ship something out (when the post office is closed).

I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and that they have a little pseudo patio as well.  It was nice sitting out there and people watching all of the crazy people who come through the Forum Shops.  Our server was very friendly, but did seem a little awkward and didn't make a lot of eye contact.  His recommendations were spot on and we enjoyed all of our food.  I over heard other servers asking tables where they were from, and it was a little overboard.  EVERY person who came to a table asked that question.  The poor table next to us must've answered 15 times.  Here is a little tip: if the hostess asks, she should then communicate it to the server. So when the server approaches the table he/she can say ""hey, I heard you are visiting from ____, welcome!"" Much more personal.

Anyhow, on to the food!!

We started out sharing the french onion soup, a caesar salad and the tater tots.  All were delicious.  The croutons were homemade on the salad and very flavorful.  The soup was served in a litte crock and was very cheesy.  The tater tots were not my favorite in town, but they are still good.  They are homemade and served with tomato jelly instead of ketchup.

Main Course:  I had the delmonico ribeye, oscar style.  The steak was done perfectly and the crab meat and bernaise were amazing.  I could barely eat 1/2 of my meat!  My guest had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is very different, but very delicious.  There was plenty of lobster meat and it was a large portion.  There was spinach, mushrooms and other things mixed in, which is different.

We had a side of asparagus, which was amazing.  Cooked perfectly al dente.  We also had the ""canon"" potato on the side, upon recommenation from our server.  I am SO glad I tried this.  It is actually an English food called ""bubble and squeak."" Mashed potatoes are sauteed with bacon and chopped cabbage and then topped with a cheese sauce.  Sounds strange, but it was a great combination!  I would go back for that dish alone.

For dessert we shared the fresh apple cobbler topped with cinammon ice cream.  It was warm and delicious, like an apple pie fresh out of the oven.

Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing.
Chocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined. 
Dear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful. I gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs. Their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years. I'll be shocked if they stick around.",2.0

Is the Chef inconsistent or just trying too hard to be creative?
I am always drawn to a menu with wine pairings. On new year last though, Bricco had a menu that didn't flow well and some of the wine pairings just didn't make sense to the point of requesting (and thankfully receiving) a replacement wine.

LdJ3Ktxs0SaPuLxMpxsCuQ,"My wife and I flew out to Vegas for the 3-Day President's Day weekend and my 50th birthday.
I reserved the car on-line at Hertz a few days earlier: A Mercedes C-Class from the prestige collection. I selected the Reserve This Exact Model option so that we would get a Mercedes.  I also signed up for the Hertz Gold membership so that our car would be ready for us and we would be able to skip the usually long counter lines at the McCarran Airport.  
None of these things happened. 
Our reservation was for 3:00.  At 2:48 I received an email confirmation that my car was ready for me and even given a stall # to find the car and license plate # to identify the car and even the color-white.  When we got to the stall there was a car, but not the car I had reserved and received confirmation for.  So, I explain my situation to a couple of workers that were walking by and they tell me that there was a Mercedes there earlier but somebody else got it.  Somebody else got it?  It was in a stall reserved for me, right?
Ok, over to the office to STAND IN LINE anyway.  The counter worker tells me there are no Mercedes available.  I say I reserved one specifically (Choose Exact Model), one was supposedly waiting for me, and I had received an email telling me this.
He tells me he has a better car for me:  A Cadillac.  We go out to see the Cad and I see a Mercedes, a white one, and I ask for it.  He tells me it's held for someone.  I say Yah, me.  He says he can't do it.  I ask why not.  He says it's on hold for someone else.
I ask why the car I had on hold went to someone else and he could not explain it.
We look at the Cad and he tells me there are two to choose from and I would like it better than the Mercedes anyway.  Is that why there were 2 Cadillacs and 0 Mercedes available?
Anyway, I agreed to take the Cadillac but was left wondering what is so great about Hertz and their Gold Club?  I had to wait in line, I did not get the car I reserved and was PROMISED.

His eyes close a bit, his mouth waters profusely, and he makes that mouthwatering gargling sound.  Do you have the image in your head?  Well, that's probably me exactly when I think about eating at Jimmy's!  It's so delicious that whenever I think about it, I have an instant craving!

The amount of food you get for the price is unbelievable!  The donairs and shawarmas are so big I struggle to finish one.  Even when I'm stuffed to the brim, I can't bring myself to throw any away, so I always make myself sick by force feeding the remaining wrap into my mouth.  I wouldn't for one second dream of wasting a Jimmy donair.  I know that everyone who goes here will all be saying the same thing: it's so delicious and marvelous that nothing else will ever be satisfying again!

The first time I went in here I had no clue what I was doing or what I wanted to eat.  Lucky for me, Jimmy was behind the counter serving people and he pointed me in the right direction of something yummy.  He was super friendly and extremely helpful.  Don't tell Jimmy but I kind of have a little crush on him.  Maybe that's why I keep going back.  Nah, it's because of how fantastic the food is.

Besides the donairs and shawarmas, they also have a bunch of little desserts you can buy.  There is a whole display of baklava and other yummy looking treats.  Along with the food, Jimmy's is also a great place to go if you want to buy some shisha or hookah pipes.  They have a large assortment of different sizes and shapes, and all the flavours that you can imagine smoking.

I seriously love Jimmy's so much.  I miss the days when a friend used to live behind the store and we ate there almost everyday.  Now I have to go a little out of my way to get there, but it's totally worth it every time.  I love Jimmy's so much and I'm positive that everyone who goes there loves it too.  It's just one of those awesome finds that everyone in the world should know about.  *insert Homer Simpson drooling here*",5.0

My good friend loves the place and found it a few years before. So he recommended a few things, we had a bottle of Riesling with our baked Bree and blackberry (I think it was jam) it was amazing. Truly, and I am very particular about the types of cheese I'm okay with (food allergies)



We were just catching up, so we didn't decide immediately that we would stay for dinner, but, why not, I choose the pasta with lobster in an amazing carrot butter sauce and he had the standing Shepard's pie, you have to see it to believe how amazing it is. 



Our food was amazing, we had a second bottle of wine, which was also amazing and although my friend finished all of his food, I've never been able to finish a full plate of pasta in one sitting, so I brought some home. I actually ate the left overs, which is unlike me.

The staff was friendly and welcoming and the menu had typical Indian fare.
We shared the appetizers, the garlic Naan and vegetable samosas, both were an enjoyable beginning.  I love eggplant, so my go to order is the Baingan Bharta with rice and that is what I had.  It was delicious, I ordered it mild and it had just the right amount of kick.  I restrained myself from not devouring the whole meal and saved enough to take home for a full meal.

The platter had 2 dolomades, that were very good and had a nice mint flavour behind the grape leaf. The house made sausage had loads of lemon zest in it and was exceptionally flavourful. Spanakopita was flaky, buttery and delicious and the octopus was nice, too. I have to say that the calamari was not as tender as I would have expected, but it wasn't terrible. They also brought us some delicious hummus that was made with fresh chickpeas. They also brought a nice helping of yummy tatziki on a plate.

AOfwC_Y7-Nh2MYZEzaDkNg,"Active Renter manages all my property in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I chose them over several other companies because they are honest, hard-working individuals who operate their business with integrity and professionalism.  They manage my property so well I never have to worry about the details.  And as an out-of-state property owner, I don't want to worry and have extra hassles!  They take care of everything, every step of the way.  Their communications are clear, concise, timely, and professional.  I will never switch and go to another company because I am so convinced I am getting honest and impeccable service from Active Renter, at a very reasonable cost.

As for the tenants who are complaining, I am hard-pressed to believe that Rich and the entire Active Renter crew have treated anyone poorly or have not serviced rentals in a timely manner. There are also people who tear up property (not their property!!) and then complain when they get billed for all the damages.  These are probably the same tenants who punch holes in dry wall, steal furnaces (who DOES that!?!?!?!), damage landscaping, tear up concrete driveways, etc.  - and then later complain when they are held accountable for the damages they created.  It's said that people who have negative comments are much more likely to post a review than people with positive comments - on a 9 to 1 basis!  So for every complaint, remember there are dozens, hundreds, perhaps even thousands of individuals who have wonderfully positive things to say about Active Renter, but just don't take the time to post a review.

From either the property management or the leasing side, I don't think you'll get better service anywhere than Active Renter provides.  I would recommend them - WITHOUT RESERVATION - to any family member, friend, and/or colleague.  They are the best in the business and their high rate of growth is proof positive they are the best property management company around.  You can't go wrong with Active Renter.  They are the real deal.

If I could give them 10 stars, I would!  They are that awesome!

P. S.  And I just have to add that the individuals who are posting negative comments sound childish and immature in their reviews.

When you join they do snake a few charges on you that you don't expect but everybody who gets your credit card does that nowadays don't they? Basic membership probably comes out to around $170 a year and that's not bad at all. 

I've been to this Gym around 40 times in the last couple of months. I've never seen any member nor staff clean the equipment so make sure you wipe down before your set. They do have staff clean the facility, empty trash, fix broken equipment which is the way it should be. 

The Gym gets very crowded at times, I think the local football team got a discount to workout there lol. So yeah, on weeknights there's a bunch of high schoolers ""working out"" their smartphones trying to be cool in front of their friends. Still, when it's super crowded I can usually get my workout in, I just have to be flexible and creative. If the place was empty it'd be really boring so there's always a positive spin to everything. 

Almost everybody behaves and they're willing to share equipment. There's no problem with the staff, they are definitely friendly which is a big plus.

 I ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens. It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.

I ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.

On another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how ""When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion."" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.

I've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience. However, the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (Tiramisu).

The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of ""I'm sorry!""s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation?

Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater.

VVAt1d3XNGb4-O_QLAN4Bg,"A co-worker of mine kept talking about Tottie's, so last night I finally gave it a try.  I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up.  I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter.  They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley.  They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about.  I also really want to try the soups, they sound good.  

All in all, it was good (I keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big.  I have enough for lunch leftovers today.  So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back.",4.0

The women at the front was flustered that I didn't have an appointment t when I asked if I could get a gel manicure and when again their were no customers. Never did I feel so unwelcome. I thought about leaving.

Finally, they took me. The nail tech complained about the gel on my nails and how tough it was to get off. She struggled with it.

EmDJPXFBhR3FOz8olSLNTg,PVSEC was amazing when our family dog was attacked by a deer. They took excellent care of our dog and provided constant updates and visits to make us feel as comfortable as possible during a traumatic time. The staff and doctors were wonderful. I was even able to call in the middle of the night and speak to a staff member about how our dog was doing. Everyone clearly loves animals who worked there and made it as easy as possible on our family. They even provided help locating another 24 hour emergency clinic when our dog relapsed a few months later while we were on vacation out of state.

CqMNjtG0hNZGhDw4RDE-zw,"I was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the ""artisan board"" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area.

This particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.

The seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.

Sometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entrée, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.

First of all, I called 5 different times to see if I could reschedule our appointment since our flight and times wouldn't allow us to make our original one. Each time they tried to find a new opening for us, and even a few hours before we went they scheduled us on a Sunday after I called. Nikki and Limmie were our therapists. They went above and beyond expectations for a massage!! They set the music to that that would fit my bf and I perfectly. They taught us (mistly my bf) all about tight and knotted fascia and stretching. Limmie went through a number of stretches and flexibility therapies on me. They had us laughing and having a good time the entire session, and we got educated without even realizing we were getting educated.

The standard dishes - chinese broccoli, xiu mai, ha cao, chicken feet, black bean pork ribs, steamed bbq pork bun, shrimp wrapped in thick rice noodle, chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle - were all a-ok.  The rice and chicken served in a vertical bamboo cup was tasty; flavors were similar to Vietnamese 'com ga', with ginger, light soy, and chicken.  The xiu mai had orange/yellow 'eggs' on it which tasted like crab innards/tomal/mustard; rich and super flavorful.  All the dumplings were packed with meat and/or seafood and not a lot of fillers (yay!).  The only downside is that the offerings are limited/uninspired; just the basics.

I started training with Bobby at Results Only right before my wedding and within 10 weeks of working out with Bobby I lost about 15 lbs and 1 dress size. My husband had similiar results. My arms never looked better...I was sincerely a beautiful bride...at age 43 I looked better at this wedding than my 1st one! 

When we first started looking at gyms we were struggling with how to fit in everything we were looking for in a gym...times of classes, co-ed so we both could attend, small enough for personalized attention, motivating enough to keep us coming back and fun...we hate working out, so if we were going to avoid going out for drinks and dinner we needed some SERIOUS motivation.

The group training is co-ed, the classes are offered at the perfect times for our schedule, the gym is near our home and the owner, Bobby, is crazy funny and terribly motivating - he keeps us going!

BUT....I really knew that Results Only fit our family and our lifestyle when Bobby introduced his TEEN fitness program to my son! Bobby was an instant hit with my Pre-Teen and now he is eagerly getting in shape and learning about fitness, gaining confidence and having fun at Results Only. We are hooked. I can't imagine where we would find a gym like this and I have tried quite a few gyms in the valley - and have great things to say about many of them - but Bobby has offered us the MOST for our family and delivered the highest level of results.

2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     12/100


I've heard about this park from family and friends over the years, but didn't experience it myself till sometime last year. After that, I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week. 

I agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more. 

- A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood. 

- A huge grassy area for picnics, soccer, and just laying out to relax, read a good book, write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here. 

- There is a path way to a small mountain, great for a short hike. 

   It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail, doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not. 

- There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.

- There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) ) 

- There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city. 

- At the top, there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city. 

- Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch. 

- There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months. 

- Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning. 

- Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well. 

*** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo, it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park.",5.0

Our server was polite but a bit...ditsy & didn't understand the questions we asked or reply with the correct response. I ordered their Alfredo- it smelled & looked terrible upon arrival but I forced myself to at least try it. Huge mistake! When I stabbed it with my fork it was one big massive clump that tasted like it was held together with elmers glue & watered down flour. Although it was luke warm @ best on the surface, it was cold underneath. Even the poor attempt @ garlic bread was laughable. Someone smeared butter on toast & sprinkled too much  garlic salt on it. It's pretty damn bad when Olive Garden's food is more tolerable than this inedible crap. 
 Our friend ordered their The Biggest Haja Steak Sandwich, this should've been called ""The Biggest Hard Turd Sandwich"" if they wanted to provide a more accurate description. When he bit into it, he literally could not tear one piece off because it was so tough & rubbery. He tried  sawing at it & the knife didn't even make a dent. When Mike stopped to ask us how everything was, Nate expressed how terrible the meat on the sandwich was @ Mike stood their as if he didn't comprehend a word that was said to him. In fact, he kept cutting Nate off & saying "" So it's okay"". Naturally, Nate was irritated & said "" NO! I can't eat this"" & Mike still didn't get it & kept talking over him. Then he walked away...he never apologized nor offered to get Nate something else to eat. He didn't remove the cost from our bill, nothing! When Nate complained to our server he didn't understand either so the nasty sandwich sat there. Our server also saw that my pasta was left untouched but never asked if something was wrong. I get this kid was clearly new to the food service industry but seriously -WTF!?!  
 My husband had also ordered a drink from the bar when we first sat down, it took our server over 15 minutes to grab it from the bar. Nate had requested a rootbeer, not only did it take over 30 minutes but our server brought out a rootbeer float & charged us extra for the ice cream! Normally I wouldn't suggest this but since the staff was ignoring our complaints, the food wasn't even edible & our patience was gone; I was tempted to leave without paying. 
 Finally, a seasoned waitress noticed our displeasure & offered to remove Nates sandwich from our receipt. However, she only took 15% off of my alfredo & removed the charge for ice cream but charged us for 2 rootbeers when we only ordered 1.

But the whole process was so smooth. I booked it through Costco Car Rentals so the rental was bit less and I got a decent rate for insurance.
Reached at terminal-2 parked my personal vehicle and took the shuttle to the Car rentals place.Reached Budget at 9:30AM to pick up the vehicle, there was one guy in the queue.
The rental guy was very friendly and he offered me 3 flavors of the Jeep and he gave me the 2015 model. The vehicle was in excellent condition and make sure you don't mess up with the vehicle while returning.

4 Star because of few issues:
- they never picked up the call before I could get my Jeep.
- Before I got the Jeep, someone had put chocolates inside the cabinet and the Jeep manual was in lot of chocolate !!!! I wanted to know more about the 4W drive but looks like no one knew how to operate it. I googled it  out and found my answers. Yes one lady came and cleaned the chocolates before I got my Jeep.

R9LpeScmNjYx3YEj9X_eyA,"Let me start by saying I wish that I could give 1/2 stars. I would rate 3 1/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives. 

The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy. 

One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.

Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.

Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent.",3.0
3-Z-1Mh5YKsFgwEaYQTFcw,"I want this place to do well, because it would be great to have a fancy Mexican option in town. I think they could make this into a pretty solid little restaurant if they fix some problems.
The drinks are tasty, but very very heavy on the ice. They are charging drink prices comparable to Boltini down the street, which actually gives you a full glass instead of all this padding. We felt a bit ripped off. I also wish that the specialty cocktail selection had some not-sweet cocktails.
One of us got a taco plate and the other got a torta plate. On both, the sides left a lot to be desired. I'm pretty sure our beans and rice were out of a can, and the potato wedges were fresh out of the freezer... The tacos themselves (1 shrimp, 1 fish) were pretty good, though! Only complaint is that they didn't double up on the tortillas, so one of mine fell apart a bit. The steak torta was pretty good, although it would have done well with some pickled chiles. 
I am somewhat annoyed that they don't provide free chips with dinner. The entree size isn't that big, which would have been fine if we got chips, but we left feeling hungry.
Another rather big oversight is not providing some sort of spicy table salsa. The food wasn't very spicy in itself. Any good Mexican restaurant should have some house salsas.

I think the main problem here is cutting corners in really obvious ways: drinks loaded to brim with ice, no chips, no table salsa, sides are low quality afterthoughts. Even the lack of the doubled up tortilla. Come on guys, tortillas are not expensive. You can afford to give me 4 instead of 2 with my $8 entree.

Another weird thing that was noted by all my dining companions: Pretty much every Mexican joint in the town has Mexican people working the back AND the front of the house, including several restaurants owned by this very same family. Here, the front of house waitstaff is exclusively white skinny blond ladies. That has to be a conscious decision.  I can't help but throw at least some side eye at an establishment that decided that actual Mexican people aren't ""classy"" enough to wait tables.",3.0

3jzsvc7iNpyppcPG0dMSrA,"I was staying across the street at the Wynn and my post-Disneyland Half Marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so I suggested we check out TI for dinner. I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, ""The Buffet"" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.

First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.

I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck",2.0

I asked the girl taking the orders about which was better, either the Panzarotti OR 1 of the sanwiches.  She answered sandwiches and suggested the Chicken.  Chicken was in a schnitzel format, flattened, breaded, & deep fried - actually quite similar to a veal sandwich!

Only 1 size of sandwich here and they were quite substantial, cut in half in which I only ate half for dinner, all for $7.  Cheaper than On-A-Bun.  A slew of toppings (cheese, mushrooms, peppers, etc.) were ALL included for an additional $1.  Not bad if you feel as though you need these additional things.

I'm not a native so when I moved to the area many years ago everyone advised my family that we absolutely had to try a burnt almond torte from Prantl's.  We did, and to be fair that is a great dessert.  However, I have worked across the street from them for a decade now, and the office ladies I work with have brought in nearly everything they sell at Prantl's over the last decade.  The cookies, the cupcakes, the junior pastries, danishes, donuts, etc... have all made there way into our office, and I have never been wowed by any of them.  In fact I find most items to be pretty sub par.  I think if Prantl's wasn't a true bakery and merely a shop that produced one signature cake it would probably deserve five stars, but that's not the case, and since I have to judge on the totality of their products as a bakery, not only the burnt almond torte which is their claim to fame and recognition, I find them to be quite lackluster overall.  If you want a true bakery treat I would suggest  La Gourmandine for anything, Vanilla for cupcakes, Jean Marc Chatellier, even the somewhat overrated Oakmont Bakery, as other than the burnt almond torte, you are paying specialty bakery prices but getting Giant Eagle quality, which is fine, but at that point you might as well go to Giant Eagle and pay accordingly.",2.0

K9dhdor2H--49Dm3k8zorQ,"We were searching for a local Peruvian restaurant and found this place on Yelp. It was the midafternoon, so the atmosphere was subdued. Some may refer to this place as a ""hole in the wall,"" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away. During our visit, the green-colored décor included a large mural, blue-checkered floors, TVs, and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area.

Santi and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12.95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice, spices, lettuce, yam, red onions, and Peruvian corn. The tilapia was fresh, nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering. The spices were nicely embedded, and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce. The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too. At first I was concerned about the portion size, but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile. 

We then shared Pollo Saltado ($11.95) made with chunks of chicken sautéed with chopped tomatoes, french fries, red onions, cilantro, mignonette and soy sauce, and a side of steamed rice. The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken. The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish. The fries were tasty, fried to perfection, and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors. I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes. It met my expectations.

The Seco de Res ($13.95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce, green peas, and served with fried yucca, salsa criolla, and Peruano beans. The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices. It was nicely stewed, tender, but also had lots of dry spots. The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish. The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins. We both loved the Peruano beans. It was nicely cooked down, subtly sweet, and flavorful. 

We were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce. The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants. 

The flavors were far-reaching, but there were a number of limitations worth noting. First, unlike most Peruvian restaurants, Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal. Secondly, service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal. But, for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table, an act I find unusual, offensive, and disrespectful. Ironically, we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened.

The server did however, give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food. Given the nice gesture, I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt, but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience.

Interested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table. I would be interested in returning to try their Anticuchos, Ceviche de Mixto, Cau Cau, Aji de Gallina, and Chaufa de Camaron.",3.0

I come here about 3-4 times a week average (bc I have a drinking problem. haha) I just never check in bc I forget. So far, they usually have the stuff I need.. lots of wine, beer, vodka,  mixers... you name it. If they dont have something, just ask.

mEwzfMkEUMcDDBwVtGUuAg,"Got here around 1:45, waited in line for about 15, not bad.  Bad happens now.  The placed jam packed and I cannot locate my friends for over half an hour.  They were playing pretty good music, too bad I couldn't enjoy myself because I was on a mission to find my friends.  I find my friends, one of them is drunk, super drunk.  Within five minutes of meeting them, one of them pukes and next thing I know is we are being forced to leave.  Did I mention I had to pay $30 + service fee to get in????  But that was just my luck, I can't blame the venue for things like this.  Would have been better if they granted re-entry upon the rest of us returning to the pool - no. Sure there are rules and one of them happens to be no re-entry, but absolutely no flexibility?  Especially at a place where bouncers ask for $200 to bribe them (yes, this apparently happened earlier in the day to my friends).  It's a nightmare trying to take care of a drunk person and get the belongings (one coat check, meaning we had to take other people's belongings too).  You are not allowed in the hotel unless you have your bottoms on (reason why we had to get everyone's stuff).  I was handed the room key and room number via text because we thought it would be easier to get back in (although chances were very slim) as opposed to two.  The security calls for paramedics and they come to do their simple check up.  I was pissed and annoyed but they were doing their job so no complaints from a sober person point of view so that was okay.  We got the okay to go and I took the friend up to the room.

I get back to the Beach Club and explained I had my other friends' stuff AND the room key without which they will not be able to get back into the hotel.  I cannot reach the other friend with a phone.  Shoot, I'm thinking I'm not coming to Vegas again.  One of the security people approached me and asked how my friend was, HOW WONDERFUL HE ASKED! Because I also explained to him my current situation and he talked to the other people at the door and they let me in. See?  There is the reasonable flexibility.  (hence, two stars, not one)

So here is my real experience at Encore Beach Club:

There is just too many people.  You are just standing in water jumping up and down OR doing the same thing outside the pool.  It is too packed.  Getting drinks at the bar is unimaginable - the line is just insane.  With that many drunk people still drinking, who knows how much pee is present in the water???

The lifeguards are annoying as hell, blowing the whistles for every single thing - no splashing, etc.  They all go insanely crazy when a guy gets on the stripper pole area even for a second, I thought an arrest was about to be made with so many whistles going off.

If you have no issues dropping the dough you could spend purchasing a very decent DSLR, go for the tables and cabanas with wait service.  Otherwise, not worth the entrance fee.  By entering here though you have a full excuse to be at the douchiest level possible for guys or to act as if you have no brain for girls so if that's what you want (seemed like that's what everyone else wanted at this place), go here without the $$$$$.  Standard party goers in Vegas but this place by far the worst.

Lock box is available for $20 by the entrance.

soEISY6l7GwgOIMYT4PDCw,"We just returned here for our second visit on New Year's Eve (our first visit was a NYE a few years back), and I'm just as in love with the place as I was before.  Sure, it's a splurge (which is why we only end up here on New Year's Eve), but it's a worthy splurge.

This NYE, they had a prix fixe menu, in addition to a smaller-than-normal regular menu, but since we are samplers, we decided to each get the 5-course prix fixe so we could try as many things as possible.

I love that a trip to Sonoma Grille is not just dinner, it's an entire event.  Our waitress, Barb, was fantastic - knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about it too.  They had just introduced some new items, so the servers had recently done their menu taste-test, and to hear her describe everything was like being there in the room as each dish was sampled and explained.

Sonoma Grille is regularly recognized as having one of the best wine selections in the city, and it's true.  The markup is a bit much, but again, you're paying for atmosphere and experience in addition to good California wines (I'd love to see a bit more Central Coast, as that's my favorite wine region, but the name is 'Sonoma,' so I give them a pass).  The staff can answer any question you have about the wine, which I really appreciate.

We started with the 'Trio of Amuse' appetizer, which had a parsnip bisque (light and flavorful), some oysters (which weird me out a bit, I must admit), and a teeny tiny beef carpaccio that was perfect in every way.  It was just one little nibble, but it was an insane burst of flavor.  While we were enjoying our wine and appetizer, the bread server came around with a selection of four different kinds of bread.  Instead of an individual table serving being brought to your table, a server comes with a large basket and serves you a few pieces of your choosing, plus olive oil for dipping.  I don't know why, but I love this little unique aspect of this restaurant.

For the larger appetizer (oh yes, two appetizers), we each got the jumbo lump crab and avocado plate.  This was gigantic - we could have easily split one between the two of us.  The crab pieces were huge, easily the size of garlic bulbs.  My only suggestion for this would be to have a few pieces of the crostini instead of just a little sliver at the bottom.  The actual plate was quite juicy, and the crunch of the crostini was a good balance.  Mmm, this was like crab guacamole, so in other words, amazing.

My husband and I each got different salads.  He opted for the fois gras salad (which he loved, even though I was a bit too squeamish to sample it), and I got what I shall refer to as the pile 'o beets.  Anyone who knows me knows my love affair with beets, and this was just perfect.  Slices of beets interspersed with goat cheese and well-seasoned... wish I could eat that every day.  Not very 'salad-y' but heavenly nonetheless.

There were five different options for entrees, but we both had our eye on only one thing: the filet mignon.  Oh. My. Word.  This steak was cooked to perfection - so tender and juicy that my mouth is watering just remembering it!  It came with garlicky whipped potatoes and broccolini (which I delicately pushed to the side - sorry broccoli, we're never going to be friends).  The portion was huge, and I had the second half wrapped up for lunch the next day.

We were nearly too full for dessert, but had to make room to try the chocolate ravioli.  It's a little weird, and the texture is a bit chewier than I would have thought, but the flavor was excellent.  It came with a nice blend of raspberry and vanilla sauce for dipping, and was perfect alongside a steaming cup of coffee.

All in all, we had another excellent experience.  Barb even offered to keep my leftovers in the fridge until after the midnight festivities, but I was afraid I'd forget in the massive crowd leaving downtown, so we walked it back to the car anyway.  I was not going to let myself miss out on a second meal of that filet in the aftermath of Pittsburgh fireworks lol.  This is one NYE tradition we plan on keeping for many years to come!",5.0

sfmp62dsseN4Kpg_3Qmy_g,"I've been to many of the Day Clubs in Vegas. Hands down, Encore Beach Club aka EBC is one of the best day clubs you can go to. One of the MAIN reasons why this is one of the best is that they actually have Gaming Tables. Most Day Clubs don't (actually, I don't think any other day clubs have gaming tables, with the exception of XS but that is a nightclub). So if you're a gambler like me, you're gonna want to go here.
Also, If you're going to book a table, I recommend booking the Lilypads. Why? Its on the water so you can chill on your Lilypad and hang out in the water. Best of both worlds in my opinion! You can't order food from your Lilypad but you can order food from the grill and BRING it to your lilypad. So you're good! If you're going to book any tables at EBC, make sure you go through a reputable promoter. I HIGHLY recommend booking with the EBC VIP host Brian Pfeiffer (773) 459-8133 - His cell phone.

It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.

I was the first person to walk in the door and ask about the dog and she said well we have to wait to see if anyone else would like to see the dog and so of course there was someone else. Mind you- this person shows up 20 minutes before they opened and I waited an hour and a half... and what happens? They do a raffle and she ends up getting the dog.

2MKuVzM2yj2muewRC_7v-g,"Since everyone in my family digs Tandoori Times, I've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and, honestly, I'm a little underwhelmed.  Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.  

Nothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.   

I was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. 

Servers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  

I do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  

The atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK.",3.0

We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.

We were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.

After we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.

We also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.

For our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. 

We ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.

Earlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.

As a residential realtor, its very important that my clients have a great experince with their investment property, as I rely on them for repeat business (home sales).  Each and every one of my referred clients have been thrilled with the service they receive from Active Renter.  Their fees are typical for the industry, and their customer service is top-notch.  When my clients are ready to sell, Rich refers them back to me for the listing.  He also notifies me of any off-market deals so I can give my investors as opportunity to buy their next rental at a discount.

In addition to referring my investor clients to Active Renter, they also manage my personal rental on 15th Ave and Northern.  They do a phenomenal job. They found me a great tenant, who takes immaculate care of the property.  The home was built in the 1960s, so it has the typical problems you would expect with an older home.

I had two cars repaired here at the same time (vandalism damage). While the actual body work and paint was fine, everything else was a total disaster. One one of the cars, a quarter sized dent in the rear quarter panel seemed to have been caused in the shop. We didn't notice it when we picked up the car at night, so we got screwed right there.

The other car was supposed to be in for a week, and it ended up taking three. They ripped off the front splitter and half-assedly screwed it back on without telling me about it, and I only realized when one of the employees accidentally spilled the beans. After we had to go back to have the replaced window tinted (which took them 3 days !), a big scratch was on the trunk lid. Some sort of white residue was all over the car, and the seal around the window was sticking up in all sorts of places. I should have sued them, but I was tired of the aggravation.

We chose a new sauce and one we had previously tried and liked. Then we went in search of cheese. Whole Foods usually has a great selection of cheeses. Well, we didn't find much. This may have been our fault, as we did not walk down every single aisle...just most of them.  We did see sliced cheeses, but not the gourmet ones we hoped to find. We chose a cashew spread that I tried at a friend's place, and got crackers as well. 

At the checkout, the cashier had a sign posted saying that she is highly allergic to coconuts, and to please let her know if what you bought has any derivative of coconuts. Well, of the two hot sauces, the rice crackers (in a box), and the cashew spread I felt good in saying 'no coconut here'. She scanned the container and proceeded to look at it from every angle, turning it over and over. She asked where the ingredients were listed. I hadn't looked, so I did not know. She then schooled me on the fact that I would be surprised at how many things contain coconut oil in them. We paid, and went to the car. I was curious, so I found the ingredients. Yep. Contained coconut oil. I left feeling like I lied to her by not telling her it contained this ingredient. Made me uncomfortable. If she is that allergic, maybe gloves would be an option for her. But now I know...I will look at all ingredients if I shop there again, or just not go through her line.",3.0

When we arrived I saw it was quite busy inside. Employees were very busy running around everywhere to help different customers. I was actually a little happy about this because I didn't want to be pressured by someone into buying a fancier keyboard than I needed. We were able to browse the selection, try different options, and decide on our own. After making our choice I tracked down an employee at the front desk (Tyler) who came and helped us right away. He asked if we need a power source, and I'm thankful he did, because that's something I didn't think about. He tracked down what we needed and checked us out. He asked if we wanted a warranty, and he was able to answer all my questions about it without pressuring me.

That said, some experiences stand out more than others. Recently moving to Las Vegas from Denver, I was nervous about finding a new stylist. I was loyal to my Aveda stylist in Denver for over 5 years and loved every cut, color, and experiment.
Today I took the plunge and scheduled a haircut as I desperately needed about a foot of hair chopped.
I met Jessica, and she immediately put me at ease. She listened to my stories of how my hair has changed over the course of a pregnancy, she understood my challenges as a busy mom, and she wisely offered advice on some face framing and bang maintenance.
She was funny, smart and personable.
And that's just the beginning of Jessica's amazing work.
After relieving me from about 4 pounds of hair, Jessica so beautifully framed my face and shaped my hair to a magnificent style.

Nice patio.

There is not one sign posted anywhere to this in the store or on the front window of the store.  The isles still have the WIC symbols on them.  The cashier said she could call the front manager and I told her what good was it going to do if they don't take WIC.  I left a full cart with her and told her I had to go elsewhere now. 
When I got home I called the corporate office and put in a complaint.  The person I spoke with had no knowledge of this but took my name and said he was going to look into the matter and advised me to call the manager at the store.

XW_k92GocXHdnMIo-Y-VCw,"Terrible and expensive experience both times. First one was a year ago, when I requested the parts fellow to order me a new muffler. He said it would be in, in about 3 days. 5 days later I called, and he forgot to order it. 10 days later, I called them again, and they still forgot to order it, despite me being in front of the counter. 
Second situation was on Nov. 4 th, 2017. My 1998 Rav 4 was not carrying a charge despite me purchasing a new battery, the evening before. On that cold and snowy day, my wife and I broke down on 130th Ave S.E. . I managed to get the vehicle as far as the Safeway Parking lot, where we were stranded. I called the Canadian tire across the street and spoke to the manager. He told me to bring it right in. Well, we called a tow truck and waited for 2 and a half hours. No biggy there as it was a busy day for them as one could imagine. We brought the vehicle in on a large flat bead truck. I asked the mechanic, where did he want it; and he said anywhere. Once we dropped it; I went inside and spoke to Ron about the problems. Ron was a super nice guy. Very friendly. I mentioned to him, that there was a loose + positive cable clamp that had to be tightened. I needed to have the alternator checked as the new battery died on us . ""After the repairs are completed Ron, could you please have them do a safety check on the vehicle please?"" Here came the upsell. "" Well, he said, we have 3 different types of safety checks. Then he felt a pressing need to tell me all about them and their respective prices. I cut him off short, and instructed him to provide me with the cheapest (100.00) safety check. 
Here in point form, were the blunders that were committed. 
1. Ron got my name wrong, my sex wrong, and all this with me standing in front of him and correcting him as he put an entirely different name on the key tag. I corrected him and even called back to ensure that the information on the work order was complete; but he didn't even bother to put down the much needed information. That's just plain unprofessional. 
2. I spoke to him about purchasing a new battery, just the night before, and that my + cable clamp was not tight. Despite this, he didn't bother to put any of this on the work order. 
3. Never informed me of the labor costs, part costs if it was a alternator and so forth
4.Never mentioned on the work order that the vehicle died while driving; but instead, said that it just stalled. 
5. The assistant manager "" Dennis"" called and left a message for me, that the Rav would not pass a safety test because that battery is not working, and a headlight bulb was out. (Well of course....why do you think it was there?) 
6. The assistant manager called me a second time at my residence later the next day; and informed me that my alternator would need replacing despite it being purchased new from one year previous. I asked him how much the alternator was and he gave me a rough cost. Then he said I would be charged. 1.2 ( which I guess was one hour and twenty minutes) for the labour. Fair enough I said, go ahead with the repair. At this point I figured;, it will be about 5 hundred dollars by the time they soak me for everything. 
7. Later that day I picked up the vehicle and it was way over and above at $683.00. When asked to explain the costs...they said they were too busy. 
8. When I arrived home, I looked at the invoice and noticed that they hadn't even taken the time to fill out the top of the safety check. Truth be known, they never probably checked a thing. No name, no policy number, no make model or year of the vehicle, no Vin number, no date...absolutely nothing!
9. Shop supplies was 35 dollars and some change. There are only two bolts that secure an alternator to it's bracket. Tell me where were there 35 worth there? 
10. The assistant manager couldn't provide me ( their customer) with the proper warrantee period for it, nor did he know how long safety checks are good for. 
** Now after all that, does this sound like a professional service to you? They should be ashamed for treating customer's this way. 
Needless to say; I won't be back for any service. They are reckless and unprofessional.",1.0

DwkEq1yx4kbb9xxVBd6iwA,"I have been going to Dental Care West, the west side clinic offered by A.T. Still University since April 2015. They came highly recommended.  

I have had my scheduled appointments change 3 times without my approval. I find out about the change when I show up for my originally schedule appointment. This is very bad customer service.

Otherwise, most of the residents are OK dentists. You have to have a new dentist every July, so I am up to my third 'regular"" dentist. To get my appointments when I needed them, I changed the resident & dentist. I found out that many of the residents and their coaching dentists don't read the files to know what is going on with my treatment before I come in. This bad practice. I also had a problem when the dentist did work he thought I needed without discussing it with me first but not owning up to it after I got angry. Frustrating.

I have to go back hopefully only 1 more time to fix the problem they created. Problem: I had root canals and crowns done and then they did the implant extraction. During the healing time, my prior crowned teeth shifted resulting in a large gap between my teeth and pain.  They do realize that this is a problem they caused and are not charging me but they keep putting off doing the work. So now I'm re-scheduled with a different resident/dentist so I can get my work done.

so my husband and i decided to try the Clicklist function of order online and pick up groceries curbside. we arrived at 7:01 pm and watched for well over 10 minutes through the glass at the associate that was manning the station took cell phone calls, cut paper with scissors, took a selfie and what not before my husband went into the store proper to ask about getting our order. well after a minute after returning to the car after talking to customer service we decided to film said associate. she took another call and what not and we have well over 4 minutes of footage of her doing nothing. at this point we hit the 20 minute mark of waiting and my husband went back into the store where he was met by the cs employee and the manager. they called the associate up and she admired she'd taken some calls and told us we should have called her to let her know we were there. the websites specifically states to stay in your car as they come out to you and no phone number or instructions to call are issued in the confirming email i received. the manager didn't even apologize for her employee or try to make amends just assured my husband our card hadn't been charged as of yet so we canceled the order. we went to the smiths on sahara and nellis our normal store which doesn't have the Clicklist feature. i told them what happened and they gave us the office number to the area and we will be calling them as well as submitting screen shots of my confirming email, my order confirmation number and the 4 plus minutes of video to their corporate email.

Kelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.

The service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.

Ravi is awesome. I used to pick up lunch here weekly then sadly moved jobs and I  wasn't around the corner any longer.  If your lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood - do not turn down the opportunity to stop in and grab a bite to eat. 

There are always daily specials and the menu is posted on the large blackboard as you walk in. There are only 4 or 5 types of wraps and they are all great !  

If you get here just before noon you beat the rush, even if you get caught in the line - it's well worth the wait.  Every single item on the menu is terrific !  

Today I brought a friend here for a quick lunch and we both had the combo of corn & crab soup and the lamb wrap !! ..........WOW was it fantastic !   The combo is a prefect lunch. 

The restaurant is small and seats about 16 at a very large communal table and there are about 4 additional tables in the back space, or if you prefer to sit facing the street, you could be lucky to grab a spot at the window.  

In the spring, summer and early fall the patio is open and it is a lovely space to have lunch.

dRQy3XkQLRSAgZ8nfmYqjQ,"I purchased a used safe on Craigslist.  Not just any safe mind you.  Oh no, I HAD to have the super high security 4000 lb bank safe ... especially at the dirt cheap price it was listed.

Let me say that again - FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS.  Two tons.  About the same as a Toyota Highlander.  5 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and about 35 inches deep.

I spent several days calling around to places to get it moved.  No one wanted to touch this thing.  Then I called The Safe Keeper.

Don (the owner) agreed to do it for $800.  More than I wanted to spend, because I'm a cheapskate.  I finally agreed since no one else would take the job.

I'M GLAD I DID!!

Don and 3 of his guys picked it up from a warehouse near the strip, moved it to my home in Centennial.  They used two pallet jacks, an assortment of wood blocks and chocks, and floor coverings.  Four turns and one 36 inch wide doorway later, they had it placed EXACTLY where I wanted it.  No scuffed walls.  No indentations in the linoleum.  No damage to persons or property whatsoever.  

Not a lot impresses me.  (See my other reviews.)  But these guys did.  Folks, the whole crew were professional safe movers who worked seamlessly together.

hc4xT4PnFvzE5QQNROLIgg,"The Venetian straddles the dual-aspect of early 21st Century Las Vegas very well.  It's got the appeal of calculated imitation that is the Adult Disneyworld but still has the polish of the Unrestrained Opulence that Las Vegas is evolving to--sort of Dubai with gambling.  The crowd here is very diverse, with wealthy foreign tourists both as guests and herded through the shopping mall under the auspices of paid tour guides. Certainly it's a monument to global ambition.

Indeed, Vegas is evolving, and I can imagine that when it opened the Venetian was the pinnacle of elegance on the strip.  While no longer at the summit, it still is a fantastic place to stay at.  The rooms are decorated in classic Italian motif, and are fairly spacious.  Some of the aspects of the room were showing their age (we did need to call maintenance at one point).  

The property is indeed huge, with a lot to offer--top notch dining, upscale shopping, and considerable entertainment (Venetian troubadors, gondola rides, shows, casinos).  The scale of the operation can be put into perspective by recounting my check-in experience.  I felt like I was boarding a cruise ship with the crowds, the processing, the walk to the cabin--all excellently done, but if that's not what you are looking for in a vacation you may need to re-think the Vegas thing.

We went off-peak (during the week) and felt the room rates were a good deal.  If I ever go back to Vegas, I'll consider staying again.",3.0

Unfortunately my experience was disappointing.  The front desk attendant offered the person who came in about 10 minutes after me a cup of tea, but failed to offer me any tea until that point when he realized he had forgotten to ask me if I wanted tea as well.  As soon as he brought the tea to me my stylist was ready so I didn't get an opportunity to drink it.  I showed my stylist pictures of what I wanted and explained in detail what I did and did not want.  She said she could do it and proceeded to cut my hair without conversing with me at all the whole time.  As a disclaimer I have curly/wavy hair.  I asked for side swept bangs that blended into my layers. The stylist insisted on blowing my hair out straight when she was finished-including a full fringe of blunt cut bangs on my forehead.  When I got home and examined my hair I saw all the layers were uneven and there was no way to style the bangs except to pull them back with bobby pins.

I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!

I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.

I came home around 5:30 PM to find the door to my apartment completely wide open. Thankfully nothing was stolen or vandalized but this just goes to show you how inept this complex  and its managers are at running a safe and responsible business. I reported the incident to management and never received any kind of response. My unattended apartment was left wide open for 8+ hours and the management couldn't be bothered to even call or email me about the situation.

They do not serve individual meals but rather small to medium plates meant for sharing.  I was very nervous about how this would work as we have very adventurous eaters in our group down to a pregnant picky eater.  Our water recommended 2 selections per person.  This ended up being a bit to much food.  The ratio of 1.5 per person would be better.  The food comes out as its ready,not all at once.  Be prepared in advance to share food. We ordered: oysters on the half shell with the siracha lime dressing ( some of our parties first experience-success), a meat and cheese board (jellies were weird-wouldn't order again), chicken wings, roasted chicken, lobster roll, sliders, macaroni and cheese, green beans, steak tartare ( skip), a breakfast dish, mussels and calamari. For the most part our entire table enjoyed all of the food and was very happy.  The rings were perhaps the biggest hit ( they are a little spicy and smokey)  resulting in one member of our party declaring we must perfect our smoking technique in order to do wings like that at home.  The green beans were also a big hit, which is shocking because we were not that excited about ordering beans. Overall we had a great time but it was in part because we were willing to share, work together on a menu selection and have fun. Go with an open mind, good group and you will not be disappointed.

This place can get really busy. I find the mall to be pleasant for an hour or two after opening, but just generally miserable after that time. I would recommend planning out which stores you'll visit and setting time limits to get the heck out of Dodge before all hell breaks loose.

The parking lot can be insane. As a local I can say that I hate even driving by here in the middle of the day during my lunch break. Wow, there is a lot happening here. People jaywalking, tourists making crazy lefts onto Warm Springs (just use the LV Blvd. exit!), and just general chaos. I do occasionally come here on my lunch break, but I park in a secret lot to avoid the chaos. No, I'm not telling where that is or how I get there. :)",3.0

Any business should always keep a consistent accounting policy.  Gift certificates outstanding should be noted in the event of a sale and still honored if not disclosed with an expiration as this one was not.

MpKouPn5PzS5qjicoSg8Qw,"I came here because of the mac n cheese. And yes, it's definitely that good. But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.

The happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.

The cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.

yUEujunJKtPttGxyprYCDA,"I have used a few different property management companies and never had such a horrible experience as I did with Paramount. I was having an issue with a non-working hot water heater which required a work order. The work order was put in and assigned to a vendor but the vendor cancelled. It was the day off during the time they should have been at my home. I told the vendor that was unprofessional and unacceptable so I would be contacting my property management. I was not rude just direct. I am a manager in one of the largest corporations so I know all about tone and customer service. Before I could call Paramount they called me. She did not let me speak or explain the issue before she advised me that I was rude and had no right to speak to the vendor that way. I tried to tell her I was not rude and she was not on the phone with us so why would she listen to a vendor over her own tenant. She said because I was a liar and she believed them since she had worked with them before. She continued to speak to me like I was not a paying tenant and yell at me like I was causing the issue. I had to remind her it is Paramounts legal obligation to provide water and hot water since I am the tenant. She said she was going to cancel my work order since I was rude and had issues. I am sorry but no matter how rude (which I wasn't) it is the property managements responsibility to make sure this is fixed. This was 3 days now with no hot water. I tried to explain I had just gotten home from the hospital from major surgery but she disregarded any empathy and continued to yell at me over the phone. I advised her I would be letting the Better Business Bureau know and the local housing agency. In the end, my husband ended up calling and her tone was totally different. She made it sound like I was the one who was irrational and upset but of course my husband believed me not her. She was speaking nicely to him until he advised her that he was my husband and he did not appreciate how she spoke to me. She then reverted back to her old self and had an attitude. He advised her that this is not how things work and it is their legal obligation to make sure this gets taken care of in a timely manner. He also stated he was an Army veteran and he gave her respect so she needed to give him respect and return. She continued to be reckless with her words so he ended the call with stating he would report Paramount to everyone he could. A manager and supervisor were asked for multiple times and she stated she was the person to talk to. We found out later that she was neither and was just an administrative assistant apparently on some type of power trip. I would never recommend this property management company because they treat their tenants like trash and have no sense of what customer service really is.",1.0

My typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.

I love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.

I finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas.

s3DktUmaIVGdGU9XDXX5qQ,"Note: This review is strictly based on the food at Fresh and not the juices and such.

First off I'm not a vegetarian but can appreciate a good vegetarian food when I have one and the food at Fresh was VERY bland (yes even for vegetarian food). 

I had the dragon bowl with the noodles and the sauce and vegetables and tofu had next to no taste (a little marinade with the grilling would go a long way). There was however some bean wrap (starts with a K) that was pretty tasty but that was pretty much it from the bunch of items we had on the menu. 

The place looked alright, but was far too expensive for the sub-par food (my dragon bowl was just $14 for sub-par fast food almost). Not only that but maybe they should've moved the juicer to the back or got someone who knows how to juice considerably haha. The juicer man kept freaking the bejezus out of the whole restaurant everytime he stuck a fruit / vegetable in the juicer and the thing would give out this awful extremely loud noise that would shut the whole place up and it would become awkwardly quiet.

Anyways I give this a 2 stars for expensive sub-par fast food, uninteresting (overdone) design, and food creation tactics. It seems the chain is just trying to catch on to the healthy vegetarian food craze and make as much money as they can while sacrificing originality and good food in the process.",2.0

Both times the food was too greasy for me to eat, and both times the people I have been with, also did not enjoy their food. This last time one of my friends had to send his food back because it was too salty (the ham) and too greasy (the toast). They were nice about it and did not charge him. 

BOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that ""this is how item x is made,"" - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble. 
Some perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried. 
It's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component. 
The hash browns are literally, round oil sponges. Disgusting. 
This is the oiliest brunch in town. Hands down. It's a shame because the space is so beautiful and open.

FhXgUQo8_rj-wO_i-JNJmw,"When one thinks of sushi in Northeast Ohio, a place on the border of Parma next to a Subway and a convenience store is not going to come to mind. Thankfully though, the check cashing place is no longer there. As a result I had driven past it many a time without a second thought. A few months ago I figured that I might as well give it a shot.

I'm glad I did, to put it lightly. The service has been attentive each time I have been there, and the decor is nice. What surprised me is that rarely have I seen anyone else eating there. Either I'm there at the wrong times or others have made the same assumption I did. I had miso soup a couple of times while they prepared the sushi, and it is just the right blend of ingredients. I'm a snob when it comes to miso so impressing me with that is a big deal.

As for the star, the sushi, it is made fresh with care and it shows. The $3 happy hour rolls are delicious, and the specialty rolls are even better. The Parma rolls in particular have become my all-time favorite, despite the fact that it is not so much sushi as it is crab on a ball of rice.

She is a very excellent cook herself and would tell the waiter if something was not to her liking. The salsa was perfect each time, with just the right amount of heat and spice, not overwhelmingly tomato-y or salty. In fact, I told the chef (who was leaving for the day) that I came from SF to have his salsa and he prepared a pound of FRESH chips and a pint of my favorite salsa to go, with a thank you note (he did this in less than 5 minutes).

I'm very impressed with The Sparklings.
I waited months and months for it to open and even asked ""when are you opening"" to a construction worker once :)

It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake. 

The ambiance of the former sushi joint 
is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.

The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food. 

We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits. 

They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.

Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)

The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol. 
The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.

I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.

I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.  

I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much.

I tried to order a Festool sander from them and it went down from there.  I was initially mislead being told that I could not pre-order a tool and that they would be getting in plenty in a month.  Little did I know that they were taking pre-orders on their 'other' web site.  It happened by luck that I found the link 3 1/2 weeks later and booked my order.  Sadly that placed me beyond the ""plenty"" that were getting shipped in November and because of the delay, I still have not got my order.  Not to say they didn't bill my credit card for a product that I have not got. (over 4 months now).

To make matters worse, their customer service is to the point of non existent.  I have tried on multiple occasions to try and get even a general date of when I will get my product that I ordered.  I keep getting told SOON.  

I found out through Festool Canada that they over booked and over sold what they were allocated.  Festool has told them fulfillement amounts and when product will be shipped out to them, but sadly Atlas will not pass that on to the customer.  I don't know where I stand in their queue for product so I am just left in the dark.  

The management is condescending if you try and talk with them.

iil8IsURyC70mvVyeUMvFQ,"When it comes to the usual Costco deals and weekly road shows, this Costco is fine, but there are two big problems with this store:

1. In the last few months, the sample severs have gotten increasingly cranky and sometimes outright hostile. They have always been rude to my kids, who are generally polite, but today takes the cake. The server CHEWED out my son for touching one sample, then the other. Normally, that would be bad beahvior, but these were fully wrapped chocolates, not some greasy fish stick. The guy -- who was working the CHRISTMAS SECTION --  was so mad, I had to tell my son not to worry about it as we quickly walked away.

About half of the servers at this store are polite enough, but NONE of them EVER SMILE.

2. Even worse than the servers are the patrons, who are horrid creatures reminiscent of goblins from the Hobbit. Here are some examples:

*One time, two elderly women started swearing at each other as they fought for the parking spot I was trying to vacate. One woman, whose husband was driving in circles on the opposite side of the parking lot, literally stood in the spot I left while the other tried to run her over. I wish I was exaggerating, but I had to roll up my windows so the kids couldn't here the exchange of swear words. 

*My kids have been shoved out of the way of samples as if they have no right to be there.

*My kids have been rammed with carts by impatient shoppers who don't seem to understand that youngsters can get disorientated by the frenetic nature of that particular store. Heck, the traffic jams near the ready-to-eat chicken area can run 10-15 carts deep.

*I've had customers literally push us out of the way to lay claim to some product or another.

The staff is okay at this store, which I've frequented since 2008, but they don't work as hard at being friendly or helpful compared with other stores I've visited. I don't know what, if anything, they can do about the bad customers, but it seems they should at least be aware that the Scottsdale store is out of control.",2.0

When I went to pay for my second appointment the girl tried to get me on the plan for paying for the birth. I had to decline her 4 times. I still received 2 letters in the mail for the plan of birth including pay by dates.

kTb7bROWOWLioKFx_DLaiw,"I was stationed in Nevada in 2012 and relied heavily on Verizon. Horrible mistake. No service in my dorm or anywhere on that block. I spent $500 on a brand new galaxy s4. After about a year, everything started deteriorating. GPS stopped working, service got worse, and miscellaneous files took up most of the space on my phone.

Verizon's fix? Spend $800 om a new phone. An A1C in the USAF makes about $17k their first year, so a new phone was out of the question. I replaced the antennas and restored service, but then It happened again; this time replacing things didn't work. I haven't been able to use my GPS in 4 years. I can't put anymore files/pics/songs on my phone because I have 20 GBs in random files that can't be erased.

The service is unbearable. I went to San Diego with my girlfriend to visit her family. I had a phone interview because I was a few weeks from separating from the mil. There wasn't any service anywhere. I drove around for 45 mins looking for service. Found it, but something malfunctioned and instead of the call going through as I stared at my phone, a voice mail popped up. I tried calling back, but all the bars dropped to zero. This was a nightmare. Ultimately, I didn't get the job, presumably because I hadn't prepared myself for the interview with better service.

It's gotten to the point where I stay at home all the time incase a company calls about a job. It's the only place in las vegas thag I get signal. I don't even get service in the Verizon store.

Their fix? Get a ne phone. Create a problem. Sell a solution. How come my laptop doesn't malfunction because of its age? I use it more than my phone because it's more reliable. The UAVs we flew had data link systems that rarely, if ever, had to be changed.

I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we both ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich. The sandwich had good flavours, however the server suggested that we change the slaw if we don't like horseradish. Really glad that I did because it seemed to make more sense with the slaw that we substituted. We ordered a side of fries as it is not included with the sandwich, and were presented with a hefty bowl of tasty shoestring fries which neither of us could finish.

However, the chicken was really dry. And when I say dry, I mean you need to soak your mouth with water to get some flavour and juice out of it. I always thought that rotisserie chicken was meant to be juicy, but this chicken seriously lacked the juice that you would normally expect. 

I think this restaurant has a lot of potential, it's situated in a great neighbourhood, trendy indoors and nice patio that offer a warm welcome with very friendly service. In fact, I would say the service is the only reason that I'm giving it three stars.

aL5qBrTc6fVo8qil_Rb2ng,"I could write a review entirely refuting the poor reviews that HuHot has received on Yelp thus far. Instead, I'll focus on what I perceived to be an entirely fun and delicious dining experience. 

To start, our waitress brought it to our attention that it was $1 Corona night. Not only that, but HuHot has a pretty decent selection of beers. Win. 

As part of your meal, you get your choice of fried rice, white rice, or warm tortillas. Another addition to the all-you-can-eat meal was egg drop soup, which was very tasty. 

We ordered crab rangoons for our appetizer - which the waitress said were made in-house - and they were pretty great. Enough so that I was a little bummed that there were only four rangoons to eat between the three of us. 

A unique selection of meat, veggies, and noodles makes up the main course. There are recipe cards at your table and as you approach the bar to help you make a decent little dish. If you trust your inner instincts as a cook, you'll do just fine without the cards when it comes to these areas. 

Mind your sauces though. This is where things get a little tricky and can really make-or-break your dish. If you don't know your sauces, go with the cards. If you insist on winging it, there is a heat meter above the sauce area to help make sure your food isn't TuHot. 

Besides that corny joke, what's there really to complain about here? Our limes were a little on the old side on our first round of Coronas. The mushrooms were running a little low both times I ran through the line. The jalapenos were hotter than Hades.  Minor.  This was an enjoyable experience through and through.

Oh, and you get to watch your cooks try to do tricks with spatulas. What more can you possibly ask for?

Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant.

QuagK5tnnjiKxN0cNdvnOA,"We have a friendly little rabbit that we needed taken care of while we went on an 8-day vacation. There were a few options similar to Springbank Pet Resort, but I am glad we chose this place!

We dropped her off in the morning before our flight. They took us to the ""bunny and small animals room"" where we were allowed to set up her playpen, litterbox, and toys just the way we have it at home. The woman taking care of the small animals was extremely friendly and I felt good about leaving our bunny in her hands. We provided feeding instructions and they put labels on everything so our bag of food and hay wouldn't get mixed with someone else's. 

We picked up our rabbit and she was ready to go for us, in great shape and seemed to be friendlier than when we dropped her off! They did a wonderful job and we will use this place again!

Pros: 
-Rabbits are only $12/day (such a deal for piece of mind)
-Friendly staff 
-Rabbits are kept in their own room away from barking dogs (lower stress).
-Rabbit was in a good mood upon pickup and litterbox was cleaned for us.
-Vet clinic next door (you can sign a waiver in case of medical emergency)

Cons:
-The only con about this place was that the room where the small animals were being kept was not as clean as I think it should have been. When we set up our rabbit, the floors hadn't been mopped in a while and there were rabbit poops on the floor that I had to sweep myself.",4.0

I'm from California and was in Vegas for the weekend with my family, needless to say trip was less than a celebration. Friday night when arriving to our hotel thankfully that's were car gave out. It overheated and just died in the middle of parking lot stopping traffic as it was in the way to parking structure. AAA very quickly arrived  as I explained the situation, towed my car to a parking space. Advice to have it towed to a mechanic first thing in the morning to get it checked; he provided two shops info to contact them in the morning as he knew lots of shops weren't open on the weekends. As soon as I woke up Saturday at 7am, I started calling the shops with no luck since they weren't opening till 8am, finally I got a hold of the closest shop to my hotel and they sadly told me they weren't able to assist me until sometime next week that wasn't doable or an option for me since I only had reservations till Sunday and had to get home by Sunday. So I went down the list of approved AAA shops and got a hold of Imperial Auto & Truck Service and I can't recalled who answered the phone but he was very polite and pleasant and did tell me that I could bring in the car but couldn't guarantee to have it fix today. I walked in the shop like a lost puppy not knowing where to go but as soon as I approach the front desk here came Ariel (my angel) she was so nice and could see my desperation in my face to the point where I broke down crying feeling helpless, she came around and hugged me offering me comfort. She got up to talk to the owner Loren who then came and introduced himself and same as Ariel tried to comfort me introducing me to the whole staff; he said they were gonna take a look at my car and keep me posted. Ariel and Drew the other owner of the shop both kept me updated on the progress of my car. I felt like a fool, I couldn't stop crying, but they all made me feel better even offered me tacos as it was their lunch time and stayed opened past their business hours to make sure I was gonna be driving home Sunday! And I did! Talk about customer service! I can honesty say they are all one happy Family like Drew one of the owners told me that day trying to comfort me.. you guys saved my disaster of birthday weekend, thanks to you guys I was able to enjoy the rest of my weekend with my son and my mom!

I'm sure if our party had gone earlier, we would have been able to get the bigger, more meaty ones but oh well.  For a first timer, the buffet would be good but coming back to eat again would be really difficult to justify the $40+ price tag.  Even on a comp, I would probably prefer to have an enjoyable more peaceful meal at the CAFE!",3.0

Q_1_FmQdH6PoFygqcGjsxA,"I'm not a vegetarian, in fact I'm more of a meat-etarian... But I would recommend this place to those who like to dine vegetarian..

Mom told me a few of her friends recommended this place, so I guess she wanted to go..

Made a RSVP for Friday night, parking was full and place was packed, so we waited 15 minutes.

Sat down and ordered a few dishes which we accustomed to and also ordered some unfamiliar dishes recommend by Yelp users.

Overall the food was very good. Although I'm not into this type of food, I could tell it was pretty well cooked, props to the kitchen!! 

Only complaint is the food came pretty slow considering we came later in the evening and by the time we got seated, the place was half empty..

I personally wouldn't come back here for dinner unless if someone wanted to go or if I had to accommodate vegetarian friends - just because I prefer meat and seafood.. 

But I would come back to try their dim sum dishes, as they look delicious and I have faith in the kitchen.

yHKMBHOo4VwPhVKO42Ub2A,"My first visit here was about 2 months ago. I'm not entirely sure when this place opened but I knew it was fairly new. Either way, I ordered the San Francisco Benedict. The atmosphere and everything seemed great. When my food arrived and I took a bite, I realized I had been given the wrong dish as this one was called the Sandi Benedict and had spinach in it. It wasn't a huge deal to me. I really just wanted avocado, so I let the waitress know I had been given the wrong plate. She said she'd fix it and went to the back. I decided to stop eating as I wasn't sure if they were just bringing avocado or if they were bringing a whole plate out. After about 5 minutes of my boyfriend eating and me waiting, a manager came over and asked if everything was okay. I replied that yes as the waitress said she was handling it. Another 5-10 go by and I hadn't heard anything. I was hungry and now my food was cold so I just started eating it. Finally, the waitress comes out and asks if the manager handled my issue. I told her that I told the manager she was handling it. She ran off to figure it out I guess. I ate my cold food and was very unhappy. The manager came over later and apologized and told me that the waitress hit the wrong item on the tablet and they are so busy with trainees that it was chaotic. She gave me a $13 voucher and did not charge me for my meal. She assured me that it isn't normally like that, so I accepted this and planned to return in the future. I would like to mention that the food was good, but the experience wasn't. 
I returned just this last Saturday intending to use the voucher and give them go #2. We had a young male server this time. He was nice and polite. I asked him how their herbal tea is (as that is all it was listed as on menu) and he said he hadn't tried it but knows it's some sort of seasonal harvest blend. I agreed to try it. When he brought it and ran off, I noticed he brought me coffee. I waited for him to come back around. I'm really trying at this point to give this place a chance but it was striking out again already. When he finally returned I clarified that I asked for tea, to which he said he thought I asked for coffee and he said he'd bring the tea. When the tea came, the water in the pot was basically almost room temperature. It was just lukewarm. I was sort of done trying so I just lived with it. I ordered the same thing I intended to have the last time. When the food finally came, my hash browns were nice and hot, but the eggs were again room temperature. Not even the slightest bit warm. I didn't complain. I just ate my cold food and made the decision I won't be returning any time soon. Again, the food is good (Should be at least warm) but my experiences here have not been the best. Maybe I'll give this place a year or so to get things together before returning. I've never been anywhere where I have had back to back not so great experiences. I gave it 2 stars for the food being okay alone.",2.0

The brisket was fall apart tender on top of Texas toast, abundantly garnished with cabbage. The mixed fries accompanying the brisket were like hot thick BBQ chips, delicious.

The real issue here on two specific occasions is this; I was attracted by all the ads and photos of their somewhat new Temari offering. It stands for ""hand ball"" or the like and are rice balls either stuffed, mixed or topped with various ingredient combinations. 

In sum it adds up to this; too expensive for the lack of quality ingredients in the 4 balls themselves. The photos are quite misleading and in the case of the crispy lobster balls is virtually faux...where's the beef comes to mind...pretty much lobster rillettes at best.

We arrived about 10:30 and they checked our bags so we could go to the pool and then called when our room was ready. Friends had raved about the pool @ Mandalay and they were right. The wave pool and lazy river combo kept our daughter entertained for hours. We ate/drank everyplace by the pool and what we really liked is not only the friendliness of the staff, but how we didn't feel milked for every last penny. Food, drink, lattes and pastries in the morning and dinner at House of Blues were all very reasonable and help to guarantee that we'll be taking the trip back more often.

aENDbtsUlxlR84H0zXOnBQ,"Looking for a place to drink and chit-chat in downtown after work. Bar Hop Brewco might be another good choice for you. They offer 36 in-house brewed beers and almost 100 bottle beers. Their yummy snack are only $5-$9. This Bar Hop Location is their 2nd location located on Peter street. Luckily, they have a roof-top patio.  So it will be perfect for a sunny day.  However, we came here when it was still cold  and they haven't opened their patio yet.

It was our first time for this location.  We came late night on Sunday few weeks ago.  It was around 11 pm and it was packed!  No one seemed to want to leave the place early .  We waited for 15-20 mins before we got a chance to sit at a barrel table.  We actually had a barrel table when we got in.  A waiter suggested us to wait at the barrel table close to their bar but two guys who came in after us just walked there and sat right away when they saw it.  Ya..they saw us too but who cares right? They were pretty drunk before they even got in there.  I didn't want to argue with them because I dint think they could understand anything at that time .  So we just stood there and waited for another barrel table.  We ordered beers to start with and waited for almost another half an hour for a real table  that we could sit and eat.  I'm a big eater! 

Food
 Appetizer
 - My luv  ""Pan Seared Mushrooms""  It was delicious!  They were roasted with garlic and glazed with  porter  It was a generous portion with a $5 price.  If you love mushroom, you would love it! 
 - Pork Cracklings   One word ""Huge!""  And only $5.
 - BBQ Tertilla Chips $5 was worth money for its portion.  It was also good with beers.

 Main
 - Fried Chicken Sandwich $15.  It was fine for us but nothing was special.  We'd prefer big puffy butter fried chicken sandwich 

Atmosphere 
 - Atmosphere was great and clean. The main floor was decorated with wood and beer barrels.  It was cozy but they have limited seats if they don't open their patio.

Service
 -  Understand that its hard to expect a good service in bars.  However, Bar Hop always has a good name on its good service at the original location on King street.  So they catch up on that for this location too.  I saw two waiters running around the bar.  I wasn't sure if they short of staff!?  I hope they have more staff next time we come by.

You have to stand there while they cook it but for some reason this seems faster than sitting at your table.  They have a wider variety of food and meat than Flat Top also and because they have the two sides of the buffet open with the same choices, you don't feel as rushed with people crowding you.

j1ltOqkUDwgfNuapeCAXIA,"I have to start this by saying my first trip to Doan's was 3.5/4 star material - slow service but friendly, I enjoyed a delicious veg/tofu pho (in a beef broth) and my dining companion ordered a bun with nicely flavored meats and a pretty good spring roll on top - but my second visit made me wonder.

I was out with my sister when we realized we were hungry, and were in the mood to have a beer or glass or wine with dinner, I couldn't remember if Doan's was serving yet so I called while on the road and a woman informed me they do sell beer and wine, but not liquor. Worked for us. My sister is also a vegetarian and although I couldn't remember if I saw a veg section in the menu, we did find one online so we figured we were safe, and then we arrived... First, our waitress informed us they don't serve alcohol yet. Um, okay? After a ridiculous wait to get someones attention to ask if they had a veg menu supplement, we were informed by a waiter that they used to, but have since chucked it. Great. Unfortunately he was unwilling to point us in any direction or give us any veg friendly options. Okay, back to the menu.

I ordered the rocket shrimp and the bun with chik/pork/springrolls (after they informed me they don't serve the banh xeo listed on their menu). My sister ended up ordering the wonton soup with tofu/veg and the tofu/veg pad thai. My food was fine, but for her, she ended up with a plain wonton soup and the seafood pad thai. If it hadn't taken so long to get the first round of food she would have sent it back, and the waitress was very grateful she didn't want to send it back and that she agreed to pick around the seafood and eat the dish. My sister then asked for a few steamed veggies on the sides to supplement the lack of vegetables in her pad thai, the waitress agreed without issue. 

Everything seemed okay, though the veggies arrived in a completely different sauce, but when we got the bill I was a little surprised. Not only did we have to pay for the seafood pad thai that we clearly did not order (and all the seafood was left stacked on the side of the plate), we also had to pay for the side of vegetables! seriously?? It was only a few dollars more in the end, but included with the lack of service (in a fairly empty restaurant), there are just better places in town to get great tasting Vietnamese food with better service.

It had been processed 2 times in one week, the 2nd time was an attempt to fix the 1st try, and it looked horrible!  I refused to go back to the other salon and searched for someone well reviewed with good knowledge about color.  I found Jessica and was not disappointed.  

I showed her photos of what I wanted originally, told her at this point I just wanted to be comfortable walking out of the house.  Part of my hair was almost blonde, part was almost black, so to give me highlights and even color throughout was going to be hard.  I thought I would need blonde highlights throughout, but she said she could get it closer to the look in the photos.  

We went over colors, she gave suggestions and input based on my skin tone. - From that moment on, I felt comfortable.  She was really taking her time. - Asking lots of questions, discussing what would look best and what would be less harsh on my hair.
She foiled me up, gave me a conditioning treatment, added a little more color, then cut, dried and styled.  She was very friendly and attentive through the whole process.  
I'm so happy, and VERY impressed.  I truly love the color and cut!!

Whether you need a ceramic ginger grater, a battery-powered pepper mill, or just a new knife, it's probably hiding somewhere in amongst the jumbles of kitchen implements here.

It's lots of fun to browse, but if you're in a hurry, it's best to ask one of the staff to help you find whatever you're looking for--otherwise, you could easily waste a half hour. Luckily, most of the employees seem fairly knowledgable about what's in stock and which fondue pot it's hiding behind. Compared to the Williams Sonoma over at La Place in Beachwood, Sur La Table has a better selection, better prices, and better staff.

Although this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end. 

The best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect. 

For my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would.

bVPTxKhjj4qyTF7_43nY-g,"Ikea is not just a store, as my fellow Yelper indicated. It is a phenomenon.

Much has been written here and elsewhere about this international mega-chain which specializes in moderately-priced, well-designed contemporary modular (i.e.,assemble-it-yourself) furniture and home accessories. Ikea is exactly what it purports to be, so there is not much I can add to its description. 

As I write this post, 28 February 2009, I am having a hard time believing my first experience at the Charlotte location of this Scandinavian retail giant.  It opened only ten days ago, and apparently the circus-attraction atmosphere hasn't worn off yet. Picture this: today was wet, windy, and  foggy. It rained incessantly. Yet, when we approached the Ikea ""campus"" via North Tryon Street, there were blockaded traffic lanes, a half dozen patrol cars, and not less than a mile of bumper-to-bumper traffic waiting to get into the parking lot. Incredible. It was as if the economic crisis never happened. I was amazed.

The giant store apparently has only one main entrance and exit, much like its big box cousins. That was particularly inconvenient on a day like today, where staying dry was a challenge. Once inside guests were funneled upstairs via escalator to begin their march around the massive showroom. Everyone was encouraged to grab a courtesy tape measure, pencil, and store map on which to make those all-important pre-purchase notations. 

The displays were massive, impressive, and incessant. I thought the furnished recreations of a living space that indicated its square footage an especially effective way to illustrate how Ikea furnishings, heavily oriented toward efficiency, work well in small, tight spaces. I had to chuckle ironically however, since many of the living spaces I've seen since moving to Charlotte are anything but small or tight, quite the contrary. But given the current economy, maybe more folks will be downsizing (I'm thinking of multiple-family McMansions with kids using closets as bedrooms- hee hee). At any rate, Ikea certainly knows how to present its information clearly and effectively, and I'm sure they'd gladly do McMansions as well as small urban spaces.

My biggest beef with Ikea, however, is purely personal. For one thing, any store with arrows on the floor indicating the direction I should walk gives me the creeps, regardless of the crowd size. I don't enjoy being herded into a space and then being compelled to move through it in any direction except the one I choose. Second, I am just not a big fan of the whole box store shopping experience, where the sheer space and quantity of stuff outweighs my eye's ability to focus on detail. I feel certain, judging by the size of the crowd, that my opinion represents the minority, but that's just me. 

I will give Ikea props in the kitchen and bath design department, where the concept of modularity and space-consciousness works well. It also appears the Ikea staff are well-trained and prepared to help customers with both the design and planning in those areas. 

I am sure I will return to Ikea, if for no other reason than I'd like to spend more time trying to focus on the design aspect of its furnishings and accessories. But until the massive crowds and homeland security-like police presence calm down, I will continue to delay my next Ikea shopping experience. Today's tightly-controlled visit reminded me more of a trip to the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport than, say, my last outdoor concert where I saw Radiohead. I will follow the direction of the crowd-police for Radiohead, but not for kitchen cabinets. Not yet, anyway.",3.0

SUMMARY
Cheese & Crackers primarily is an order ahead market. The name 'cheese and crackers' is misleading, as what they offer stretches beyond cheese. You can order a range of things like artisanal cheese trays, cured meats to seafood. The trick is to visit their website and sign up for their mailing list. There, you'll get a better feel for the range of products Cheese & Crackers offers on a weekly basis beyond what you just see in-store. 

PROS:
- Order Seafood: They have a mailing list to order fresh seafood. Sign up on their website. They bring in fresh, high quality seafood from Canada. I went to a dinner party that served fresh salmon from here - was delightful. 
- Catering: They are a great fit for catering, in particular artisanal cheese platters and trays. 
- Baguette Sandwiches To Go: They serve sandwiches on baguettes like thinly sliced roast beef.
- Cheese Assortment: They have an extensive list of featured cheeses.

CONS: 
- They don't offer in-store or to-go cheese plates - only order ahead. I would love to be able to stop by, select 3-4 cheeses, take them home to try that evening. 
- They have a few bistro tables, but the store footprint is small thus it isn't really a spot to hang out in-store. 
- The sandwiches are only served on baguettes, and the baguettes are really tough on your teeth / hard to bite. Would be nice to offer another bread option for sandwiches, as the sandwiches are very tasty.",4.0

Pizyh5YMEUtYJ9hMAP2Mbw,"This is going to be long...I'm sooo satisfied with the customer service my boyfriend and I received from Jesus! Our stroller was bought as a gift online for $560. Now it was online for $399 so I called the Target.com phone number since the stroller was purchased online and asked for a price adjustment. They said I would have to put my stroller back in the box, return it in store or mail it back, & repurchase online to get the credit & they would ship me another stroller. Kind of a hassle but I thought $160+ was worth it. So when I got off work, I look up the stroller online to make sure it's still available and it is NOWHERE to be found on the Target website. I call the online number, spoke to 2 different people and both said I could purchase through the phone at the price I saw online, $399. So I box the stroller back up, drive to my nearest Target, explain to Jesus & what does he do? Dismiss everything I explained, he asks me to login to my registry, scans the stroller box & says, ""Whoa! That's a lot of money!"" Refunds to a gift card $611.48, scans it again, tells me it's now $279.96. I was like, ""okay!"" Obviously I wasn't going to argue with that price when I was originally going for the ""$399.99"" price. Lol He hands me my gift card and tells me, you have a credit of $308.84 left on the gift card. I thank him and we walk out with our stroller. Definitely a big score! I had been dreading the inconvenience of having to wait to get my other stroller in the mail. So walking out with my same stroller was awesome. I went home and set it up again & I also ended up purchasing our baby monitor and glider from the Target website with the credit we received. I could not be happier. :)

About 3 days later, I walked in to return a baby bath tub for store credit. I received 5 for my baby shower so I was looking to see where some had been purchased since I hadn't gotten gift receipts. Once again, Jesus helped me out. Super friendly, super fast, no hassles!

Zr0tumZG1Na8E7_v8YipTg,"I need to begin this review by stating: I hate Brussel sprouts.  As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.  

As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.

When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!

How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!

Outstanding, However that was the only part of the dish that was going to be eaten by my son.  This dish should be changed to just Biscuits and Gravy!  

Let me make a note that if it was not for the hostess and the guy bringing by the coffee I would have given breakfast 0 stars. However I am giving breakfast 2 stars for the things that were good.  

Also if you read the reviews it is obvious that Guy and his staff have written this place off as a lost cause because I cannot even see where they have replied to any of the reviews they have received.  Good or Bad.

Experience #2. 2 Stars.

Over all we give Guys a very charitable 3 stars.

sOZ_f0suc5E81uLIiMHuJw,"This is a home reno supply store, similar to a Home Depot in the middle of Little Portugal. But unlike Home Depot's gaudy orange and grey monstrosities of warehouses, this supply store is jam packed with aisles brimming with essentials. Walking around, it's like you're in a maze with more cool stuff waiting around the next corner. They have sections devoted to different aspects of building things with staff on hand to answer questions. The check out counter is well staffed and right by the entrance making it easy to park right in front on Ossington, jump in the store and quickly dash away. What is super impressive is their bathroom piece selection. Upstairs they have a showroom with modern freestanding bathtubs and fancy showerheads and kitchen sinks lined up showcasing beautiful design. If anyone knows ceramic tile, the Portuguese know it better than anyone. The selection is fantastic! The mecca in the GTA is Olympic tile, but after going thru Olympic, Downtown Lumber won out with its tight selection of choice tile designs and helpful staff. There is even free customer parking right behind the store where a tight laneway leads you to almost valet style parking, very nice! When your order for lumber, cement, or tile is filled at the service counter in the store, you take the invoice down the back laneway where the warehouse is tucked away. After a couple visits I was most impressed how the guy back there immediately came out to fill my order after driving into the tight spot. And he even loaded up the heavy tile into the car (they also deliver!). Super service from some incredible and dedicated people. Thumbs up Downtown Lumber!",5.0

I arrived early but was greeted and offered refreshment immediately. Really loved the vehicle and started negotiating. Basically told them what I wanted and could do and they met me exactly there without any issue. They also gave me more for my trade in than anyone else had offered. It took a long time to get with the finance manager and that part was the only real detractor from the experience. 

I did notice the typical extra items they could have tried to tack on and it sounds like from other reviews they sometimes try to add that stuff on, but if you give them the bottom line and have confidence knowing what you need in your vehicle, probably won't be a problem.

They say they have 24 hour maintenance and they will not show up outside of regular working hours. They have an answering service that takes a message and they don't get back to you the next day. You still have to call again. They came into my house rearranged things to get to a valve and did not put anything they moved back. When I asked if they were going to, they rudely rolled their eyes and said, ""probably not."" The women in the office are rude overall. They are rude when I ask for my packages, as though it's such a pain for them to get up and get them. They are stuck up and fake. The pool is so cold I can't stand being in it for one second. No one picks up their dog feces. They never have bags for people to pick up their dog feces because one person steals them all for themselves and the lazy ass office bitches refuse to fill it up even though one of them works every day. You hear random dogs barking all day. It NEVER stops. You hear dogs barking from the ghetto behind the building too. People from the neighborhood break-in and use the pool and work out room. It is such a high crime area, there is no way to safely take a walk without being mugged. The work out room is so small that it's hard to get a machine because of the people from the hood next door using the facilities. There is no where to recycle and you can bet I got a rude answer when I asked if there was one. There is no outgoing mailbox. You can leave your mail on a table in the office and hope no one steals it. However, that entails looking at the 3 wise bitches in the office. The maintenance man is nice, but obviously overworked from the crappy buildings he has to service. He looks suicidal every time I see him. A fire broke out and burned 3 apartments because of faulty wiring (which means any of ours could go next). Just when you think your silence about all of the issues going on here has paid off, they increased rent over $100 to renew my neighbors lease. Then they tell him that he has to give them 2 months notice when he was paying month to month. I do not want to get into the poor construction. It has the usual thin walls and difficult to clean surfaces. You can hear everything from your neighbors having sex to the bass from their music. There is no parking at all.

-rpyY-kxaz52ygEJoXjZrA,"I saw the Titanic Exhibit here on a Saturday morning. It was a fantastic experience which I highly recommend for everyone. But as we walked through it, and especially as I saw all the wide-eyed kids captivated by what they were seeing, it saddened me that a huge number of Phoenician families simply can't afford the tickets. $20 for adults, $15 for kids as young as 3. Do they really need to charge 15 bucks for a 3 or 4 year old to see this with parents? Come on. The exhibit took us about 90 minutes to complete. I'm docking two stars just because of the price, which is shameful for a so-called nonprofit to be charging the public. 

Price aside, the exhibit is wonderful. It's in Phoenix until May 4, 2008. To avoid standing in line, I recommend buying tickets on-line as we did, though there is a fee for that. 

You start off by being handed a somewhat cheesy ""ticket"" of one actual passenger who traveled on the Titanic, with some basic information about him or her. The exhibit wants to put you in the actual shoes of that person as you walk through, which I thought was effective. Only at the end of the exhibit do you find out whether your passenger survived the sinking or not. 

I chuckled at the passenger I was assigned to, who was a prominent Frenchman traveling to Montreal, Quebec for the purpose of designing a bust of the then Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfred Laurier. Of course I felt a personal connection to Monsieur Chevre, as a former Canadian Prime Minister and Montrealer myself. My companion was assigned a 21-year old Englishwoman who had bought a 2nd class ticket, and was traveling with family to New York for her wedding to an American. 

The exhibit is designed to be a comprehensive lesson on the Titanic. It sheds light on how artifacts were discovered and retrieved from the ocean, the design and building of the ship, what the interior rooms looked like for 1st class and 3rd class passengers, lifestyle and daily routines on the deck, and finally the collision with an iceberg and sinking of the ship. Over 1500 dead, out of over 2000. 

Hundreds of artifacts are on display, from personal items, to fine cutlery, to a door taken from the ship. The one that struck me the most was an old uniform top that still had its owner's faded name, ""Broom"", on it. Mr Broom was a first class steward who perished with the ship. All of the artifacts bring to life a snapshot of the world as it was in April of 1912. Even if you're not interested in the Titanic itself (and I am not), anyone who enjoys history would enjoy this. 

There was a guy dressed up as a passenger there who, to my amazement, either had an incredibly impressive fake Irish accent (and I fancy myself as pretty good at detecting fake accents), or he was actually an Irishman. I decided not to ask him directly because answering me would require him to step out of character. He was somewhat knowledgeable about the ship, as I found out by asking him about the decision to have only 20 lifeboats instead of the 32 that could have saved every passenger on board. The cut was essentially made for the sake of having a nice view from the deck. Nice work, ship designers. 

I will say that the analytical lawyer side of me was slightly disappointed by not seeing much that focused on the factors that caused the ship to hit an iceberg and sink. There are exhibits telling the basic story, but I was left wanting just a bit more. Still, by the time we reached the end and excitedly looked up our Frenchman and Englishwoman on the manifest to see if they lived or died, we were delighted to have finally seen this exhibit. We cracked up as we saw one 8 year old girl ironically complain to her mommy that ""her"" passenger died even though he was ""really really rich"".

ZBV6JTBUgucsH1_lfqIB5w,"POP was just what I needed on the first 3 digit day in Vegas yesterday! Situated in the corner of a large strip mall on Fort Apache, I was across the street for a lash appointment and decided to make a pit stop at Hobby Lobby. Felt parched and walked into Pop thinking it was a bubble tea joint, nope definitely not that - as the name implies it's pop for my midwesterners. Not just any old pop, speciality drinks made with pop. 

Such a simple concept honestly, but very well thought out and executed. I'm not much of a pop drinker, after all I counsel against it. But every once in a while I'll give myself the option, luckily it's not something I crave. Initially it was the feeling that I had walked into the place assuming it was something else but felt odd walking out. I got to looking at the menu and looking back outside at the sun beaming down and thought I'd give it a whirl. Have to say, I will be back!

Soda is used as a base ingredient to craft a drink. So if you create your own you choose a size, pick your soda (or tea for my healthies), pick your add ins. I appreciate that they have an XS size which for me was truly a S. Great for portion control people! Then they have a menu with fool proof recipes created for us. I chose the Jojo because I enjoy Dr. Pepper and substituted the coconut cream for vanilla cream. Yum! They also have a secret menu (see picture - white) of drink creations and needless to say I was overwhelmed with options. Finally, they have a foods fo pair alongside your beverages, popcorn and cookies. A kids menu per say - an XXS drink (12 oz) with kid size popcorn. Also, got beverages, coffee/hot chocolate. 

Aside from my beverage being delicious, I appreciated the service. It's a very simple concept so to speak, so the fact that the employee took his time to talk me through the menu was above and beyond. The pricing was right! The shop has ample seating, parking. You get a stamp card for return visits. I wasn't told explicitly about a guarantee but I'm sure my drink would've been remade had I not liked it.

My boyfriend loved his kabob, and I tried it and it was pretty good. The rice was kind of greasy and there was not much taste. The only thing that made the food different from other middle-east style eateries was the salad dressing which my boyfriend thought tasted like Big Mac sauce, and this other sauce for the meat that he said tasted kind of like salsa (not that it was bad, just saying).

6or-6g_8n7HlTQ6ZWE8zrw,"First off, Green Valley Ranch Resort is a hidden gem in the suburbs of Vegas. I am told its part of the 'Station' family. 

Dinner. We had an awesome wine recommendation, so perhaps the vino impacted my rating!  They brought out a seafood platter that could have fed an army: oysters, lobster tail, shrimp...unbelievable. 

Most of the table ordered steaks, and raved. I was just not in the mood, so I ordered french onion soup and buttermilk fried chicken breast. I never order fried chicken...but the server was correct that it was a hidden jewel on the menu. Moist, and Southern comfort food at its best. 

Expect a large bill, but its Vegas, which means no more inexpensive meals.

Kmu7D_u25Zz_3wFcbzO_nQ,"Was dragged here on a Saturday night after a birthday dinner. I knew things were bad even as we approached the entrance. I could hear the music blaring from down the walkway, and when we walked in I felt like I was going deaf. The DJ they had was cranking his levels to obnoxious extremes, and with the sterile decor the sound was bouncing in all the wrong directions. It didn't help that the DJ was terrible to begin with.

The bartenders ranged from jock-like dudes and cleavage-heavy women. All of them seemed slow at their jobs and were too consumed pouring dozens of shots and making fancy drinks to get any of us a simple beer. We drank pints of Kronenbourg, which tasted really off and quite gross.

The washroom situation was one I wish I could have avoided: a bunch of drunk dudes waiting in line and hitting on any woman who happened to be waiting as well. I let a couple girls go ahead of me in order to avoid the onslaught of lame pick-up lines.

The crowd was a mixed bag. My girlfriend said the only people who go here are people who already live in Liberty Village, which makes sense seeing as I don't see why anyone who lives elsewhere in Toronto would specifically make there way here.

We stayed here for about 30 minutes. Terrible in every category.",1.0
bt-YOeBNBfm2M79wGpuaSg,"I was quite surprised by my visit to Adega.
We had a reservation for 8:15 but showed up around 7:30 and they told us our table was waiting for us. Their tables are quite distant from each other, so you can actually listen to what your friends are saying 5 stars so far!
After we made our order we got bread and olives, which is typical for Portuguese restaurants I guess. I don't go to too many, so I'm not an expert. Bread was okay, but kind of generic. 3 stars for that
Food was another matter. We ordered the appetizer platter and some shrimp on the side. Everything was really good, and tasty. Their portions aren't even small, cause I felt  I was getting full by the time we finished the appetizers.
For main dish we all tried something different - seafood and meat. If you go there go for the seafood! My duck breast was tasty, but the portion felt small. My meal was the smallest of all. I didn't leave hungry so it didn't bother me.
Overall, I'd say food is really delicious, but not so imaginative. I felt like you can have some of the dishes at other places. 4* here
Desert: I ordered the creme caramel and everyone tried it. Everyone got wowed by it! I haven't tried creme caramel in a long time, but it was definitely what you should order if you ever visit 5* on that
Service: attentive and polite. Not much else to say. I have no remarks! The waiter was a really nice guy. This could be considered both good and bad, but I felt we had to wait too long to get our main dishes. I didn't care cause we were already having a good time, but for someone who's in a hurry it might be a problem 4.5 stars on service

Tried the Portuguese beer which was nice, but expensive. 

To sum it up, while the place might not be exactly 5 stars if I have to be more objective. My score reflects my overall experience from dining in there.

Would I go back again? On a good occasion for sure.
This place should also be perfect for a more quiet and romantic dinner!",5.0

r2mTPBeCs5noVOvh41QazA,"Britney is one of the few stars that has ever existed that can command an entire arena, that emits spiritual and psychic positive energy through her voice and performance that has the power to change how an audience feels.  I have seen this countless times, at nightclubs: boring after boring song comes on, but when the DJ plays Britney suddenly the room erupts.  Very few performers had the ability to do this, in history.  Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland... the names on this list are surprisingly few.  However, Britney Spears is one of them.  She has the power to illuminate a room, and the World, with her work.  I am not quite sure she realizes this, she is probably far too humble, which is an integral part of  her mysterious Greatness... but I digress.

I did not feel the staff at the Axis theater were worthy of her.  They were rude, rushed me into my seat and out of the theater just as soon as they could, and I barely had time to buy a tee- shirt.  I snuck next to the glass display to take a picture next to the ""oops"" outfit, and they practically yelled at me.  More so than anything they actually did, their demeanor was extremely GRUFF.  I can't think of a better way to put it.  Nothing exactly happened... no one slapped me in the face or kicked me in the arse... but their words were short, rude, aggravated, impatient, and unsympathetic to a fan that had traveled 5 hours that very day (from Los Angeles) to see his idol.

I am a huge fan of Elvis as well, so we stayed at the previous Hilton where he'd performed and had a fine time touring Elvis' old dressing room. We went to 1 Oak, had a Crab Buffet, and had a mini shopping spree at the Forum Shops. But of all the fun things we did AFTER, I could not shake in the back of my mind the negative cloud of what I'd experienced at the place that drew us to Vegas to begin with.  These people need to realize how much being in that theater means to some people... it is almost a spiritual experience.  When Britney levitated from the tree during Toxic, I almost felt my soul levitate, too! 

Shame on them, for poisoning such a momentous experience.  As usual, ignorant peons in the world will spoil Greatness.  But there is enough negativity in the world, a point I think Spears herself combats with her positive soul and music.  There need not be any negativity in the arena of a performer who does so much to expunge the world's ugliness, and there need not be unhappiness spread in the very Pantheon where Spears herself is employed to make us happy.  She was born to make us happy, that is her soul's purpose... so let her do so without the grumblings of those who can only think of what they are going to have for dinner after their shift is over.

VncR4VqbwldiJ7PKaSkKzQ,"Went to the White Brick Kitchen three times in the past 2 months. Twice for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. Absolutely love this place! 

We had the buttermilk half chicken ($17), green beans (special side, changes often. Added $3 on top of chicken) and sloppy joe fries ($14). The portions are really big. I packed a doggy bag from dinner both times. The buttermilk chicken is so crispy and fresh. You can choose to make the chicken spicy for an additional $2. We didn't do that because I'm not into spicy food.  The green beans were baked with cheese on it, which was unique and delicious. The joe fries were really good. They did not skim on the ingredients. A lot of meat! The sunny side up egg was a nice touch. This dish has a kick so beware non-spicy eaters! 

The second time I went for dinner, I had the chicken again and a side of cider slaw. The chicken is always good and the slaw wasn't bad. I also had a toffee pudding cake with caramel and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pretty sweet, but rich and tasty. Good to share with 2 people. 

Overall, dinner was great. Only complaint was that the food did take about 20 mins to come both times. I think it's because the chicken was made to order so beware of this if you are on a time constraint. Definitely worth the wait though. 

The brunch is only available on Sundays. We had the turkey croissant (special item, changes weekly, I believe. About $14, can't remember exact amount), Scottish eggs ($10) hickory bacon ($4) and homemade ginger beer. Everything was so fresh and flavourful! Loved the brunch here!

The food is on the pricier side, about $25 to $30 a person for dinner and $15 to $20 for brunch, but you pay for what you get here. Totally worth it. Service is okay.

That was two months ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about that mouth slathering, soul-filling pulled pork, guacamole and tortilla sandwich.

I've been a bit of a boring adult these days; meal planning, watching my language, posting mommy-blog-esque quips on facebook, staying off yelp because I had nothing new or exciting to review... So when I found out that FG's was going to be at the Wychwood Barns beer market I dropped that ladle for the chicken soup I was making for my sick husband like a hot potato, ran across the street and then straight back home to enjoy my two sammiches.

The pulled turkey with purple slaw and bacon jam was tender; sweet but also savoury in all the right places.  

The beef short-rib and homemade kimchi made me break out in a post-coital sweat and I assured my husband that, yes, it is THAT good, while I tried to speak between bated breath.

That was lunch.  I just enjoyed the second halves of each sandwich for dinner.

My next appointment was for blonding. I have been trying to get a hairdresser to do this for three years!!! I could never convince anyone that I'd rather be blond with dark roots than brunette with grey roots. My hair is 50% grey and now I can finally work with it rather than fight it!

Initially,  I was a fan of Allegiant.   Early on , my extended family used it to get to Vegas from the Midwest.

We came here the other night because I had a craving for crab legs. I had the 1lb snow crab legs but instead of having the corn and red potatoes that come with the dish, I opted for the roasted mixed vegetables and a garden salad. My husband selected from a four-course special they were offering and chose cheese and broccoli soup, a caesar salad, shrimp and scallop linguine and the caramel cheesecake for dessert.

Everything I've ever had at this restaurant has been delicious and tonight was no exception. The service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable albeit quite a bit more dimly lit than it used to be... you can still see your food, just not the person you're dining with (I kid!) and although the restaurant was relatively full, it was surprisingly quiet.

wJchWlQhqmcPjnPf-WccUQ,"I had waited a couple of months before making my first reservation at Lardon and I'm glad I did.  At 6:00PM on a Saturday night, we arrived promptly at the newly renovated restaurant and was greeted by their hostess, Doris, who was warm and friendly.  My party of seven took the remaining reserved table available in this cozy, dimly-lit restaurant.  The decor was simple yet relaxingly sophisticated.  The main entrance was lined by large open windows and the kitchen, situated at the opposite end of the restaurant, offered a glimpse into the brainchild of this joint.  At the pass, stood chef/owner Jacky Lo, ready to command his troops with military precision.

Four members at my table were actually back on their 2nd/3rd visit and I was advised that everything on the menu was to be desired.  Our server was knowledgeable and helped us navigate through the plethora of Italian jargon and we all agreed to order to share.  We settled on the following from their new menu:

Cornish Hen x 2
Steak Frites
Duck Confit
Parmigiano Reggiano
Rainbow Trout

Almost immediately after placing our order, we were surprised by some bread paired with a side trio of sun dried tomatoes, olives, and anchovies.  The table was torn as to which of the three complemented the toasted bread but we managed to clear the plates within minutes.  Personally, I enjoyed the anchovies the most as their saltiness just hit the spot.  Not normally an olive lover, I found the olives to be fruity and fragrant.

As the main course came out, the first thing I noticed was the clean presentation.  As for each dish:

Steak Frites - Done sous-vide style, I had never experienced a piece of beef that was done so perfectly a medium rare (as recommended by our server).  This is in agreement with Meagen B.'s review.  The only complaint that I had was that I was required to share this dish with 6 other people but that's of no fault to the restaurant.  Interestingly, the frites were actually my favourite part of this dish as the potatoes were thickly cut, crunchy on the outside, and soft and buttery on the inside!  Mmm, yum.

Cornish Hen - The hen arrived already de-boned with a crispy, golden brown skin and sitting on a bed of beluga lentil and carrots.  A bite into the hen revealed a hint of sweet alcohol which we later discovered was from the shiaoxing wine marinade.  Not necessarily my favourite dish but others seemed to really like it.

Duck Confit - Normally confined to dried pasta from a box, Lardon's fresh pasta was a first for me.  The duck was succulent but what sealed the deal for me was the sweet pieces of pear that accented the dish.  Nice!

Rainbow Trout - This was probably the star of the entrees and really the best bang for your buck.  The trout had an amazing smoky flavour that was infused deep within the fish, underneath the crispy skin.  I highly recommend this dish especially if you enjoy quinoa!

Unfortunately, I was sitting at the other end of the Parm-Reg so I can't comment on it.  Though, it looked on par with all of the other dishes.

Though full, the entire table shared one of each choice from the dessert menu which included:

Creme Brule - Thick custardy texture, maximum vanilla bean flavour, topped with a crackling sugar crust.  The best I've ever had.

Mango-Lemon Grass Sorbet & Berry-Basil Sorbet - The mango sorbet tasted like a perfectly ripe mango while revealing hints of earthy lemon-gress while the berry-basil was just to die for!  Top it all off with a fresh biscotti cookie.  Perfect.

Chocolate Mousse - Creamy chocolate mousse tower lined with a cookie crust matched with (if I remember correctly) a blueberry compote.

Bacon Maple Syrup Ice Cream - The name says it all.  You need to try this bold dessert on your next visit!

All in all, we enjoyed a laid back night at Lardon along with good service and a well executed meal.  I can't wait to go back and see what the chefs have to offer as the season/menu changes.",4.0

cyUZsSbSwWXhM60Ln6CGuA,"My girlfriend and I were very excited to drop by this new restaurant and was not disappointed!


Highlight: The bruschetta rocked my world in ways I did not know it could be rocked.


The Vibe: unique and welcoming. This is a small restaurant with seats for around 30 people inside and maybe 15-20 outside. Combined with plain wooden tables and fun cutlery, makes this an intimate experience. The middle of the room has what appears to be a homemade chandelier made from glass jars. One wall has a large vertical fern garden (with real ferns!). It was well put together without overstating itself. I love it! Jack Johnson was playing in the background, which added to the relaxed theme.
 

The Service: Wow! These were some of the most attentive and knowledge staff I have experienced. I never wanted for water (which came with a hint of cucumber). The sourcing of menu specials were described (cheese from the Goat Lady). The server that we had was pleasantly talkative and I could see great opportunities for small talk, if that is your thing. Very courteous and friendly!


The Food: 

- Bruschetta (deserving of 3 paragraphs): I am not a bruschetta guy; however, this was hands down the most delicious appetizer I have ever had. This appetizer lived up to the name and actually stimulated my appetite. In fact, we both were left craving more throughout the dinner to the point of seriously considering getting one more order for dessert (it's not sweet, just THAT good)! 

This aint no red paste/salsa looking glob on a bread. No, it was asparagus, tomato, lion's mane mushroom (and some more veggie yumminess that eludes me at the moment) perfectly seasoned on a crispy, garlicky, buttery slice of bread.

The only possible downside is that the restaurant changes its bruschetta daily (or maybe weekly), so future experiences may differ. However, I fully place my bruschetta trust in the chief to deliver and WILL be ordering the bruschetta in the future.


- Arugula salad: This came with arugula, walnuts, pumpkin, and pumpkin seeds with a pomegranate dressing. The portioning of the salad seemed in-between a side salad and dinner salad. Definitely get a side or appetizer (bruschetta mayhaps...) if you are hungry. 

Whereas certainly not bad, we both found the pomegranate dressing to be a bit too intense and sweet--overpowering the other flavors. 


- CM Burger: solid veggie patty with toasted wheat bun. The patty was particularly enjoyable because it was not trying to be like a hamburger in texture or taste. This resulted in a crispy on the outside patty of veggie awesome. The toppings were fantastic. Only drawback was that the patty tends to fall apart easily, but this minor inconvenience is well worth the effort. Would get again!

- Side of Veggies: the burger came with a choice of sides. I choose the veggies, which contained squash, zucchini, carrot, onion, and green beans. These were sauteed perfectly, not soggy like defrosted mixed veggies. The green beans could have been cooked a bit longer, but a minor issue. Deliciousness comes at a price though--butter. And lots of it. Veggies can only taste this sinfully good with a large amount of butter. It didn't bug me at all, but it may be a concern to others.


Overall: Coming back again. Soon. Even though not a vegetarian, I really appreciate well-prepared vegetarian food. There is a lot of variety  and unique flavors at Fern and I am not done exploring yet.",4.0

Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended.
The menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you're left feeling optimistic.
But here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups, staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It's sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything.
The food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the ""Ragin Cajun,"" which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed ""meat,"" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the ""meat.""  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn't eat it.

Overall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it's location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I'll never go back, and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that's the kiss of death.",1.0
MQxu_QsTlsZGTd22U51jhA,"A nice small breakfast spot located across from Siems eye center and Dr. Tran's office.
I'm not familiar with this area, so it was difficult for me to find this place.
Came here for late breakfast.
The waitress (blond lady) was very nice and cheerful. She suggested me to get roasted pork belly benedict. Korean boiled eggs caught my eye so I decided to try that also. She said Dr. Tran always order Korean boiled eggs when he's here and it's delicious. My food came out in 25 to 30 min but it was nice that they give complementary chips and salsa. 

Roasted pork belly benidict... Delicious! Poached eggs were perfectly made. Roasted pork belly was exactly like ""Char siu"" you would get in some Ramen shop. Very fatty and melt in your mouths. I was expecting to get muffin type bread but the bread was like french baguette toasted very hard. I couldn't cut with the knife so I had to pick it up with my fingers and ate it. 

Korean boiled eggs... When I saw ""Korean eggs"" on the menu, I thought of ""Korean sauna eggs"" which you would get in Korean spas (they roast eggs in hot sauna for hours) but completely different thing came out. It was exactly like ""Nitamago"" or ""Ajitama"" you would get in any nicer Ramen shop. Perfectly done sweet soy sauce flavored Nitamago. I loved it!

It was nice for the chef to come out and talk to every customer that was there. He was a very nice person. He explained me how to make perfect Nitamago (well, Korean boiled eggs) with vinegar and stuff. I don't know if he's a owner chef or head chef but I hope this place gets a lot of business!!",4.0

2F_xCXajKuST7Q_Q_Xw7Jg,"I have an old-fashioned standard about fish tacos, which many taco places in Toronto fail.  A fish taco's focus is the fish fillet and the tortilla, not the garnishments.  Garnishments make a taco tastes better and unique, but they cannot replace the importance of the fish fillet.  Many taco places I have been to in Toronto want to wow customers with garnishments, but they go cheap on the fish.  They either use fish fillets not fresh enough, or choose a type of fish that is not meaty AND make the fillet too small, so the texture of the fillet is completely overshadowed by a big pile of garnishments.  The Combine Eatery passes the standard.  Yes, the tacos are expensive  The fillets are Basa fillets, a non-meaty fish.  Yet the fillet is big enough that the fish flavour comes through the garnishments, which are fresh.  The texture of the fish fillet stand up to the volume of the garnishments.  The fillet is fresh. The diner controls the spiciness level of the taco.  And this, my friends, is how I like a fish taco.",4.0

This trip was different, it's another story, and what can I say, this show is pretty awesome.  This is actually my first time to a Las Vegas show.  It's pretty much all Beatles music with a Cirque du Soleil performance of their crazy high flying stunts.  There is so much going on that you shouldn't get bored and you'll end up leaving thinking how did they do that?

The meals were delicious and hit the spot for us...we were so into our dishes that we didn't even get a chance to dig into the shortstacks - we ended up taking them home for a later splurge. I was a little bummed that they upped the prices by a couple dollars from what is listed on their website (someone needs to UPDATE that stat), but in the end it was still worth it. Eggs were cooked perfectly for both meals, the green thai butter used on mine gives it a nice kick of flavor and spice. Spam pieces were fried just right, not underdone (yes, this is possible) and not overdone. The tocino was marinated pork belly - again, great flavor and texture.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the little details incorporated into each dish...garnishing was spectacular! The chef even came by our table to check on how everything turned out - that was a very nice touch...From other reviews, it looks like kitchen efficiency can be a hit or miss I guess depending on when you get there - glad we got there when we did, because when we left, the crowd certainly picked up and it appears that the kitchen got backed up from what another review states of their experience from today as well - I remember seeing that couple come in with their baby, it's too bad they didn't get a spectacular experience.  Hubby was greatly impressed with this place and that says a lot as it's very hard to please him. We are fans!",5.0
Mt5L6WlkeSxJOI8d00J0Kg,"The dollhouse was an excellent experience for myself and my two friends!  We wanted to have a girly night out, and of course, part of that involves getting our hair done.  I found out about the Dollhouse through a friend of mine, who highly suggested we try it out.  I am so glad we did!  They wash and condition your hair, massage your scalp, and put a fragrance of your choice into your hair.  I chose spearmint, which smelled heavenly!  Then, they give you a glass of water and champagne with a sweet treat in it.  I normally don't like champagne, but this glass was amazing.  Then they ask what kind of style you are looking to get, then work their magic.  My fine flat hair looked supermodel gorgeous when they were done!!!  My friends and I had such a fun time here, and I suggest this place to anyone looking for a girly thing to do with their friends.",5.0

I'm one that takes reviews into consideration but I also like to come up with my own. Arriving at the hotel it seemed nice. Slightly run down but nothing to bad. Upon entering the room was a different story. Immediately when we went into our room it smelled like sh*t literally. The ac unit on the wall only made it worse blowing out warm air. The carpet was dingy, the sunken tub was filthy and there were burn marks everywhere from the room to the restroom counter. Even though they advertise non smoking can't blame them for stupid people making breaking the rules. Within the first 5 minutes I honestly had to vomit from the smell and did. We immediately went back to the front desk and let Alicia know that we just couldn't stay. She was very apologetic and helpful and let me know that if I notified groupon for a refund she would honor it. So thank you Alicia for your customer service. If rumor can get the cleanliness in tact with the customer service that Alicia gave their profit and customer feedback can improve.",2.0

_kpiQtd-n_xXk_oY9m5PhA,"I went to Paul Mitchell The School after I saw a $19 Groupon for $30 towards a service.  I called at 9:30am to make an ombre hair color appointment with a Phase 2 student.  The receptionist was able to book me a 1:30pm appointment that same day with Jaymee.  Even though Jaymee is a student, she really knew what she was doing.  She was teaching a newer student (Rachel) about the techniques for ombre.  It made me feel very relieved when Jaymee was explaining each step of what she was doing.  Because I have very long, dark, and thick hair, I knew the appointment was going to take a while.  After starting at 1:30pm, I was out by 5pm.  This is understandable due to my hair and because students need to review their actions with their instructors.  Keep this in mind if you are thinking of coming here.  I feel 100% satisfied with my hair color service by Jaymee.  I also enjoyed the complimentary hand and arm massage I received from Rachel.  Overall I give the service I received 5 stars!  My ombre dye job cost $50, after I saved $11 from buying the Groupon.  What a great deal!  My suggestion would be to request a Phase 2 student (especially Jaymee!) if you are planning to get a color service.  It is well worth the extra ~$10.  Another great thing I found out is that men haircuts are $5 on Tuesdays.  You won't regret it if you come to the Paul Mitchell School.

Our group came in and we ordered the Captain's Boil, and the two other seasonings with mussels, clams,  and shrimp.  I ordered a fish and chips for myself as well as a side of corn.

First of all, the place is very conscientious of hand washing, with a washing station at the front entrance.  When you go downstairs, the washrooms have a sink inside as well as in the hallway!  Bonus points for that.  Also bonus points for their caesars which use a fresh stick of celery in it.

Food was a bit garlicky for my taste though.  The seafood came nice and hot, but the flavour of the garlic overwhelmed the seafood for me.  When I took the last piece of clam out of the bag, I couldn't taste the freshness of the clam anymore even though I could tell the seafood was fresh.  I was glad I got the fish and chips, which was perfectly fried and had generous portions.

It didn't help that the minced garlic tasted like it came from the industrial sized tubs you can buy in bulk pre minced.  I did use the sauce to dip my cajun fries with though, which is the best application of the sauces.

She tells me she can't get me in until next Tuesday. I ask to speak to someone else as she's made it clear it isn't up to her. She calls in a gentleman who is the only one who says halfway nice. He steps out and sends in another woman who is also AWFUL. She continues to repeat herself saying she doesn't know what to tell me and she can't help me.

The breakfast pizza was wonderful but on the smaller side and the goat cheese was applied unevenly resulting in 2 slices with a large amount and 3 with almost none.    Taking a few extra seconds to even it out would have been a big help.

Gm-l5_7w4kfiHCWUONYtgQ,"Made my online reservation with Hertz as part of my airline discount package in order to rent a car for the weekend of Electric Daisy Carnival 2011. Everything within an hour Vegas was BOOKED solid, and I mean solid. I was able to find one of the lodges 2 hours out of town that had space, so I was set. 

***Here is the important part of the entire review: I got a discount because it was PREPAID.

I got off of work, made it to the airport on time, checked in early, everything a-ok, even had my print out of my reservation and info to pick up my car rental at 10pm on Friday. I go to the ticket counter, and the staff is taking their time. Fine, I can still make it to the lodge on time and check in. This is also important, because the front desk is not open 24 hours. After midnight your screwed. The receptionist was willing to wait up til 1am for me to check in, though. But no later, as this place is so small no one else is at the desk until 5am. With only a few people in line in front of me, I should be ok.

Nope. Staff is so incompetent and computer system is so archaic that 30 minutes passes before the NEXT person is served. The manager tries to get people to use the Hertz electronic kiosk, as she can tell we are all frustrated with how SLOW the service is. I'm a savvy travel and think this should not be a problem and take the kiosk route with a few others. But the couple in front of me have issues with their reservation, and flag down the manager to help them (she is VERY pregnant and can't deal with the stress of 10 minutes of nothing working).

My turn at the kiosk. I try several different methods to get my reservation. Scan my print out. Type in my reservation number. Put in my credit card info again. 15 minutes of attempts, and nothing. By now I would've been in the front of the line. Finally the kiosk recognizes me, and tells me to SEE AN ATTENDANT about my issue. I get back in line and wait another 10 minutes before anyone can help me (thank God they didn't put me in the BACK of the line again). 

At this point I WASTE another 10 minutes as the reservations agent at the terminal can't get my reservation to go through, despite the print out and online info on my phone. THEY ARE SURE WILLING TO TAKE YOUR MONEY, BUT NOT GIVE YOU THE CAR. They cannot take the credit card I provided. YET THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY. 
When I showed them that I had been charged already (yes, I brought out my bank transactions, this has happened before and this usually works) they STILL WOULD NOT RENT ME THE CAR I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR. 

Now the manager gets involved, as she can sense my frustration with the staff to a perfectly simple and logical transaction. And what can she do about it? Nothing. Not willing to get on the phone and talk to Hertz, or to over ride. Is this for REAL? A rental service that operates 24 hours a day and you can't get anyone on the phone to fix this issue? And she wasn't going to try? EVEN THOUGH THE RESERVATION FOR THE RENTAL WAS PREPAID AND YOU TOOK MY MONEY?!

By now in my anger I had missed the call that the receptionist at the lodge was checking in with me. Whatever TIME I had buffered to make it to the extended deadline to check in at the lodge was now SLIPPING AWAY. Knowing that my frustration was mounting, I walked away and waited in line at another car rental agency and got a car. 

That's right. Walked up, waited in line 5 minutes, talked to an agent from a competitor and got them to MATCH MY CAR TYPE AND DISCOUNT with HERTZ and get the paperwork car within 10 minutes TOTAL. I went back to the HERTZ desk and asked to make sure I was getting a REFUND FOR A CAR RENTAL THAT WAS PREPAID THAT I WAS  *NOT* GETTING. 

Guess what the manager said?

No.

At this point I cussed out the agent that initially helped me and the manager because they know NOTHING about customer service. You can't release the cat to the same credit card you were MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE PREPAID MONEY FROM, and WON'T REFUND THE MONEY when you can't give me the car. No print out that says I was NOT given my car when I call Hertz billing come Monday. 

By now it's 11:30pm Friday night when I drive off in a non-HERTZ car, and I have to fly like a bat out of hell to make the deadline at the lodge. I would have to deal with Hertz later, as I had wasted enough time with them.

I've rambled enough, but in short guess who SLEPT IN THE CAR in the parking lot of the lodge? Surely it wasn't a HERTZ car that I slept in, no sir-ree -bob! 

In summary, even with all the paperwork, print outs, online info and correct identification info on my person, HERTZ would not rent me my prepaid car, nor would they refund it. Due to the length of incompetent  time and poor service I received at Hertz, I did not make my reservation on time at my lodging. 

AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.

We had a 7pm reservation, called in 4 days in advance, and we were seated at 8pm with no menus, no bread, no wine, except us whining that we felt like this was an episode of ""Hells Kitchen"".  

We had to laugh (group of 6) and we were not in a hurry, yet we had to ask for everything, server, wine, another wine, ect...  We finally got bread at 8:22pm, and after the bread the salad, and steaks came out pretty quick, but they could not figure out who's steak was who's...and the three women's steaks were all delivered to the wrong person, one had to be sent back, ordered M.R. brought M.W., not good...brought a new steak Rare...and the same person got shorted wine from the person as they tried to pour to all six  of us from a bottle of wine brought to the table uncorked with the cork in the bottle, not good...

All of that on our first visit ever to DC, and they did not offer us anything for compensation, no offer, no nothing...""sorry we are still learning""...""thanks for your patience""...""It's been overwhelming"" told to us by our server...

Similarly, dinner was reasonably good but there was nothing that was particularly amazing or stood out.  The roast beef at the carving station was probably my favorite.

oqAU_iv2P6VlG_csIkbDng,"Ambiance: 
Let's start with the location.  This Mexican-Korean fusion bar & restaurant is located in Korean town.  It is one of Playacabana restaurants or the MAS PLAYAS Group.  However it seems to be influenced by the neighbourhood.  That is why you can see many Mexican-Korean items on the menu like Baja fish taco with kimchi, K-Mex Slaw, etc.  Barrio Coreano can be a good choice for people who wanna explore a new taste of MEXICAN-KOREAN food.   The restaurant is quite small but I think they can accommodate up to 40 - 50 guests.  If you like RUSTIC DECOR, FUN & FRIENDLY ambiance and don't mind to be very close to other tables, you will like BARRIO COREANO.

Food: 
We ordered quite a lot because we didn't plan well , also misheard when our waitress told us that they ran out of the special beef steak taco.  We though it was the White Fish Taco that was out.  So we ended up ordering two items of fish tacos, the White Fish and Grilled Baja Fish .  
 
 - Fish Taco : The white fish taco was good but I'd prefer the baja fish which came with kimchi. Three baja fish tacos are for $13. If you have only one is $5.  We got three. They were very tasty.
 - K-MEX SLAW ($12):  We wanted to try something new so we ordered K-Mex Slaw as an appetizer. It came with a huge dish of Korean Cabbage, creamy fresh Mexican Cheese ""Queso Fresco"", fresh Avocado, Corn, and topped with Ginger-Sesame Dressing.  It was an interesting dish.  However, I am a chip-eater  so I ordered the Guacamole & Chips in the end   I couldn't finish it though.
 - GUACAMOLE & CHIPS ($9): I heard that their Guacamole & Chips were good however, it might not be my day.  My chips were a bit burnt and not warm as many people claimed .  The Guacamole was good though. 
 - GRILLED KALBI BEEF RIBS ($14): My husband ordered the ribs instead of the special steak taco that was run out.  He said these Korean Short Ribs were very good.  The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa and Cucumber-Radish Kimchi made the dish more delicious. The Arbol-Tomatillo Salsa brought a kick of  spiciness. As I mentioned, if you like a taste of Korean food, you would like these Korean Short Ribs. 
 - *Dipping/ Hot sauces: Don't forget to ask for their house hot sauces! It is the MUST if you love spicy! I asked for it a bit late when I was about to fish my tacos .  I didn't plan well..I didn't plan well!  It came with four small bowls of different hot sauces.  The red one is the spiciest!!! 

Drinks: 
It's a bit harsh if you don't have Mexican food with alcohol, isn't it!?  Makes your journey a bit more fun with Michelada! A Mexican drink made with cold beer ""Modelo Especial ($7)"" and mixed with clamato juice, freshly squeezed lime juice, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  I normally don't like Bloody Caesar or a drink with hot sauce.  However, this MICHELADA ($7+$2) totally changed my mind.  I became a spicy-drink lover .  

Barrio Coreano also have other interesting cocktails.  They are $12-$14.  We didn't get any cocktails this time.  We had only Michelada and Beau's Nordic Pale Ale (600ml for $12).  The Nordic Pale Ale is brewed in Ontario.  It was dry and low to medium bitter.  

Dessert:
 - CHURROS POUTINE:  a sweet version of Poutine.  Sweet Churros dipped in a rock glass filled with warm caramel and melted marshmallows . The dessert that you will fall in love with  if you like SWEET.  

Service:
 - Reservation: It is a good idea if you make a reservation.  We didn't do it though.  Luckily they had a small spot for us at the time because the customers was about to leave when we got in .  Make sure you ask your server for everything you may want at once so you won't miss anything and don't have to wait.  They seem to be busy in the evening, especially on weekends. 

Price:  In my opinion, it's a bit on high price side for some items.  However, taco prices are average.  I would recommend to order one each of tacos to try out with their house hot sauces.  A bottle of beer would be nice with spicy food~

Wanted to get reservations for a Wed. night but told that none were available so we decided to chance it.  Arrived around 6pm and was seated in the downstairs level, right at the table next to the bar.

Ordered some wine and appetizers to start - warm olives ($5), gnocchi ($5) and buttermilk calamari ($11).  Their calamari is usually a favourite of mine but this version was a bit over deep fried.  Texture was kinda tough.  The coating wasn't as fluffy as I once remembered.  Gnocchi was coated in a creme fresh and lemon but a bit bland tasting, not a lot to it.

For pizzas, we got the classic Margherita ($13), Cremini Mushroom ($17), Ontario Prosciutto & Arugula ($16) and the special of the day which was a pizza with lamb and rapini ($18).  

It's been awhile since I've had the mushroom one but it was great and I even loved it over my Margherita.

Desserts - how could we say no?  We went with the Tiramisu, Posset al Limone and Chocolate-Amaretto Budino, all $7 each.  The Posset was awesome...a light and refreshing lemon custard.  Tiramisu is always a winner.  Sweet and boozy, just how I like 'em.  The Budino was okay.  More like a chocolate mousse/pudding.

_on9HNc8kXj9rHSW9VVJnw,"Came with a large group for a special occasion.  We decided to see what's the hype in this prestigious duck.  Throughout the dinner, we experienced up-selling of the duck, why this duck is worth the price. Each employee had said different things - so here is a consolidation of the differences between $88 and $118 according to the restaurant:

The $88 duck is a 4 lb duck, vs $118 is an 8 lb duck.  Only the bigger duck have enough surface area to carve out the peony flower.  This flower presentation is also copyrighted in China as of 2014 - therefore you can only experience the unique presentation at their restaurants.

The duck is LOCAL. Regardless what they say, these ducks are not flown in from Beijing.  A waiter did tell us only the $118 is from a specialty farm, vs $88 is not (we asked the Manager to get the right story)

The pastry/pancake is from Beijing - to maintain its ""quality"". 

The finely green spring onions are specially ordered from a vendor - as it is unique in its ""fine chopping skill""

When you receive the duck at your table for the presentation of the carving, you will be given a show, including a ""gong"" to start the show, and to see how the peony is created.  

Was this duck good? It was tasty. However as the skin was so finely carved out, I found it was difficult to appreciate the crispiness of the skin. 

3 stars for the service - we did get a lot staff which came to explain to us on the restaurant history, the food detail, and explanation of the menu. We had a staff specially stayed around to serve us (why? I don't know why, he just floated next to us). HOWEVER, everyone was very courteous, and we appreciate their consistently walkthrough of each dishes and story-telling.

Were the other food good? They were all very flavourful - however generally more greasy, with higher price then typical Chinese restaurant.  We anticipated to have the Squirrel Fish, which unfortunately the waiter forgot to put into our order (our table did not make a big deal, as he was very courteous.

Waiter (Frank)-5 stars
Food-4 stars

The canoe appetizer was so yummy! But for 10 bite sized pieces of food, $26 is a bit much. 

My husband had the prix fixe and it's an awesome deal. The bi bim bap appetizer was tasty but a lil on the small side. His hangar steak was done to perfection. The soufflé dessert was great if you like super chocolatey stuff. 

I had the fish trio. The seared ahi was ok, but the salmon and butterfish were the better of the 3. If only the butterfish tasted more like miso like it was supposed to. 

Overall, great and solid 4.5. I'm from and love the one in Hawaii so that's the only one that gets a 5 from me :P",4.0

The waiter was very nice, and kept constantly refilling our drinks, which was very good. 

Food quality is OK.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, for the price you pay, the cocktail shrimp should be without shells, but it isn't. Also, the shrimp are kind of small compared to other buffets of the same price.   There was lobster tails, scallops, oysters, and many other seafood cooked in different ways, but nothing tasted outstanding. 

Sincerely, I was expecting something outstanding because this was all seafood, however it didn't surprise me at all.

I don't know how anyone can speak with such attitude and be so critical towards a customer that they don't even know. It was very strange and off-putting, I don't think I'll be returning.

My portion of food was decent, I wasn't able to finish it all (got a rude remark from the server about that), but my friends portion seemed very small. It tasted alright, nothing too special.

Our server was kind and attentive and I had a salad that a monkey could prepare well, so I'm giving two stars for those successes. But, my salad had no flavor besides a few olives to set it apart from a standard side salad you'd get for free at a Red Lobster or similar cheap chain.  The beets were just beets in a bowl, absolutely no flavor at all.  The margarita pizza my friend had was shocking considering this being advertised as a Mediterranean/Italian fusion spot, and she didn't have the heart to send it back.  It was clearly a cheap (or poorly, previously made) frozen pizza that they tried to disguise by throwing a couple of slices of tomato and a few sprinkles of unfrozen (note that I'm not using the word ""fresh"") cheese on.  She was starving and swallowed parts of two pieces, then I took the rest home thinking my husband or father would eat it since they'll eat almost anything, especially in pizza form.  Even they wouldn't eat it, so that was $8 or so in the trash.  I hate writing bad reviews without talking to the staff to give them an opportunity to fix it, but it was pretty clear that there was no pride or care given to the foods served there.  It was not the waiter's fault and no ""chef"" that allowed that kind of food to be sent out to a table would make a fresh pizza and flavorful second batch of beets had we sent them back.",2.0

Menu has a variety to chose from. I decided to try out goat karahi. I confess that it was a tricky dish to chose from because barring a handful almost all places in North America fail at it. And the it failed the authenticity test. Goat in Indian/Pakistani cuisine should not have that peculiar aroma that you commonly find in Mediterranean lamb or goat dishes.

Upon striking up a conversation with some other customers we learned this is one of the few places in the city to get true home cooked Bengali food. The mother of the family that runs the place apparently cooks the food just like she does for her family. And, after tasting the food, I believe it.

We didn't bother with the menu. Instead we just asked the young daughter of the owners to give us a sampling of their dishes, mostly the non meat ones. We ended up with an absolute feast.

To start we had lentil pakoras, a fried bread stuffed with lentils called dalpuri, and a chickpea-like dish with onions and potatoes called bwot. For mains we had a tasty spicy lentil soup, a vegetarian curry, and kacchi (beef) biryani, all served with delicious, fresh pratha.

Everything was good, but the kacchi was mindblowing. The rice in this dish had the most amazing subtle spicing. Not sure what was in there exactly but damn it was awesome. And extremely fresh. Only available on Friday though.

We finished with tea and a variety of desserts including a lovely pudding with caramel. I'm not huge on South Asian desserts but these were pretty good.

All this was easily enough to feed the four people in our group and we were shocked when the bill came in under $30. An unbelievable deal for this quality of food.

Recommended order: dalpuri, pratha, and kacchi biryani.

The ""wrap"" is a small tortilla that is folded around the egg thing and is somehow baked or steamed.  It was gross and inedible.

We had a reservation at 7 and they sat us promptly by the window so we could people watch. The vibe is casual yet somehow upscale. The décor reminds me of my mother's kitchen, comfortable with a touch of French attitude. The menu is fantastic and I wish we could have ordered everything. We did not feel like making our way multiple times to the chalk board which shows the menu. Our waiter was more than happy to give us appetizer and oyster suggestions and we went from there. The fried oyster appetizer was unmatchable. Three fried oysters assembled on top of a giant oyster shell had special sauce and lemons on top. The artichoke app was equally as impressive. I wish I knew the names of these dishes, but I was about 5 drinks in at this time. Of course my mom and I ordered the Lobster Spaghetti- after looking at everyone's pictures, you kind of have to. A Huge price tag comes along with this dish, however, the amount of lobster you are consuming is enough to feed the entire city of Montreal. I loved every bite of this dish and got more and more upset when my plate was becoming emptier and emptier (or I might have just gotten emotional from all of the wine).

The wine selection is never ending and the white that our waiter picked out for us was a perfect dry chardonnay. What was even better was that the couple next to us didn't finish their wine (that is unacceptable) and gave it to us. Their red was one of the best red's I have had.

There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude. They don't know what good customer service is, and I am warning everyone I know about them!",1.0

The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice.

AuRb_qohWKa_5fEy6KVClA,"Wow, guess my review was a bit premature.  I'm now going thru a similar experience with James G.'s review of 3/1/18.  I believe his story is spot on since encountering my own grief with the billing dept. of this office.  I spoke with Michael too, at exit of my last cleaning using their 12 month $299 plan, on 2/28/18.  He gave me options going forward for the 2 plans they offer and he said ""NO NEED to choose one now since I don't have a cleaning scheduled till 5/31/18.""  He said ""the plan is 12 mos so you'll waste 3 mos of that waiting till 5/31/18.""  I knew this already and was not going to choose either plan that day.  He made NO mention of needing to sign a letter rejecting an automatic renewal of that plan [which I was totally unaware of] by the next day 3/1/18.  Lo and behold, when paying my Capital One card Sunday 3/11/18 I see Cherrington Dental charged me $299 on that very next day, 3/1/18, without my consent.  Not only that, they DID NOT send me a receipt for that $299, so I had no idea it was done.  Had I not gone over my charges as usual I would have missed it.  Pretty low down sneaky and rotten thing to do to a patient of 1 year!  Where was the question, do you want to renew for another year, or change plans?  Or, will you have insurance this year??  Questions never asked.  

This is supposed to be a dental practice helping/caring for patients.  So, I called the Dental office and was told by Angie that Michael & Tammy were busy, that no charge reversal would be done, and that I would receive a return call that afternoon - 3/13/18.  Of course, no call came 3/13 or 3/14, so today 3/15/18 I called Capital One to start a dispute to reverse this nonsense.

Their signature drink the Shark Bite is your basic caffeine-infused cold beverage. If you like coffee and you need a shot of caffeine, you will find none better.

Still, service is good and they are friendly.

QHn-GipFW_WFcUabN55Row,"My gf suggested we eat here because they have ""better"" food, which I suppose is implied by the higher price they charge for dinner. 

This is not the case. 

When you're in Vegas (or anywhere, really) you have to remember that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet. 

Sure, they've got Kobe (not really, we aren't in Japan) beef, lamb, sushi, Alaskan king crab legs, snow crab, flank steak, shrimp cocktail...

... but it all tastes like buffet quality food, which is a better way of saying they're mostly terrible. 

Do you know how difficult it must be to coordinate a meal big enough to feed hundreds, if not thousands, or people? Do you possibly think quality can be a factor in cooking these meals?

Where is the satisfaction in getting a thick slice of Kobe beef if it's so tough your knife can't get through it?

Like king crab legs? Then you'll hate them here, since they're all machine-cut, partially frozen, and it tastes like they've been sitting in a salt water bath for a week. 

I wouldn't even mess with the sushi. I'm very, very picky about my fish, and whatever they were serving here looked one step above the grocery store. 

Even the desserts were mediocre. 

If you want to eat well in Vegas, go look up a decent restaurant and drop the $70 you'd spend here there. This last (and I do mean LAST) buffet visit proved once and for all that no matter what they're serving or charging, nothing beats paying for freshly made food. It isn't worth cramming sub-par servings down your gullet just to justify the cost of what you paid to get in here. Unless you have no discerning tastes, or you're just a big fatty who loves to binge eat (hey, no judgment here... do your thing) then this just isn't the place to waste money in Vegas.",2.0

Well, yea, it was, sorta.  But does poached mean there would be uncooked egg white and yolk running over the salad?  A fellow, seemingly ""in authority"" stopped by with the full expectation that we would lavish complements on the establishment.  We also told him about the problem.  No response -- he moved on.

I initially started my search for help and look for help on Yelp with contacting another well-known company.  However, that didn't pan out.  Luckily, I had found Roy with extensive research and he responded immediately and professionally on the phone, which shortly carried out with an inservice home visit.

Cindy is the best and one of her shellacs lasted almost a month! (With some tlc on my part).  They are pricey, which was previously my only issue. But worth it.  Sadly today I had my first negative experience and even more sadly it was with the owner Tina.  I requested a pedi and shellac and Tina worked on the pedi and mani, then handed off to Cindy for the shellac.  I was actually glad she did.  I know Tina is very busy which make me feel as if I wasn't being attended to and rushed- very rough pedi.  The salon had a bad bottle of Polish - color too thin - which I has picked out obviously unknowingly. I guess Tina thought it was mine because she spoke in a brusque tone about it and made me pick something else .  Only afterwards did she learn that it was their polish, not mine.  Perhaps Tina needs more staff so that she can focus on managing rather than doing nails because she seems way too busy to do a top notch job, which is what I've had from the other technicians up to now.  You guys are too pricey for anything else less than the best service.  Based on today I could have gone somewhere else and paid half the price for this level of service.

oNTaR4WcJgQbMoDktbrQ0g,"My experience seems to have differed from that of many people here.

Our waiter, Elias, was extremely efficient and friendly (ok, he did get a little snappy when he realized we'd finished eating a while earlier and hadn't called for him for the next course, but we were dining, not just experiencing the dark, and enjoying each other's company), never mixed up orders, projected his voice expertly so we always knew when he was coming to us and not to the next group at the long table (a gap of one seat on either side was left between us and their party).

My fish and veggies was quite good. I like breading and crunch on my fish, so that suited me quite well. The rice was lovely, though there wasn't much. The veg was slightly over-steamed green beans (my guest got steamed asparagus with his steak). I'd called that ""fish and veggie,"" no ""s"", but that's just a quibble. 

As previous reviewers have mentioned, you're hunting your food around the plate and more than once (especially with something like green beans, that can be hard to keep on a fork when you CAN see what you're doing!) you'll get a fork to your mouth only to discover there's nothing on it.

The desserts were sorbet and chocolate mousse. The mousse was delectable, though it had some sort of soft brownie or cake beneath; I literally couldn't get just one mouthful cut off and found myself with a HUGE chunk that needed to be nibbled off in the dark. I felt like a little kid, because without my napkin to scrub my face, I'd have left the room with chocolate *everywhere* on my face. 

I know some people find the ""atmosphere"" straining or uncomfortable in the dark. I was actually with a friend who is usually quite quiet, but was much *more* animated in the dark and we had a wonderful chat while we enjoyed our food.

The room is *dark*. They have double-layer black-out curtains to keep all light from the door or kitchen window out of the room; I'm *extremely* photosensitive so could just make out a bit of movement when my friend waved his hands at me, but that was it. 

The one warning I'd give, other than the ones given by others here (and I definitely disagree with some of them - we enjoyed our food and the service, though it wasn't the best meal either of us had ever had), is: 

If you are photosensitive, BE CAREFUL.

The moment I walked out of the dining room, I had *stabbing* pains in my eyes. So bad strangers were offering me sunglasses, and one of the sighted servers saw me in obvious pain and brought me to a very dark corner to give my eyes more time (she mentioned that they do, occasionally, get a customer like me, whose eyes don't adjust back quickly, and recommended I keep sunglasses on until I went to bed).

The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!

iJrt7x1TRawSKeEGK2p_-w,"Only reason I stopped in was because I wanted the Lorac mega pro palette 2 and Sephora doesn't carry Lorac anymore. 

I purchased the palette and when I got home the entire thing was covered in gold shadow, one of the shadows was broken and spilled everywhere.

I had to go back the next day and when I mentioned the need for the exchange I didn't even get an apology, she just said ""make sure you check this one"" which I had already done.

I also noticed that the Lorac section had a sign that stated a gift with purchase, when I mentioned it to her she said ""we ran out of the gifts"" not even giving me eye contact. I then told her, well then I suggest you take down the sign...to which she didn't reply.

It upsets me because this is a 60.00 eyeshadow palette (that's not cheap) and they act like they're doing you a favor. I know retail during the holidays is tough but they are like this year round. The customer service at this location is horrible, I'd rather go to Sephora or order online. I'm not dealing with their attitude anymore.",1.0

IC5-QaTSVZuzHG9LQ56z-w,"Had heard some good things about Marigold Maison and decided to check it out on a Sunday evening. 

We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers. 

We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.

For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency. 

Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none. 

The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of sautéed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion. 

The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus. 

With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was ""we are really busy and need you to leave right now."" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that. 

I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill. 

The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive.",2.0

Vhod6fuBKheaXbJX4gOEMw,"We stopped into The Social Page to look for some cool wedding items and ideas, although we didn't buy anything we did leave a little more inspired with some fresh ideas based on some stuff we saw. The Social Page started as an extensive and unique stationary store; they do appointments and consultations to bring your ideas from concept to completion. These days it's also a great local store that carries fashion accessories (mostly female), jewelry, toys, giftware, home décor, novelty items and other seasonal items. Despite specializing more in the stationary area they have some pretty cool gift/décor items which was why I wanted to visit.

The 3 biggest reasons I'd suggest checking out The Social Page is 1) They have unique stuff you wouldn't find elsewhere 2) They're diverse, they have a lot of little knick-knacks in a lot of sub-categories of giftware and décor, and 3) They're local! I'm a bit disappointed they don't showcase much of their wedding accessories/décor in-store as this was the primary reason for our visit. If you're looking for their wedding stuff as well you'll likely be re-directed to their online store. They have a lot of great items for weddings online, but what's unfortunate for me is it's really just a partner/affiliate with the parent company ""weddingstar"" when you shop online. weddingstar is a solid supplier, but it takes away from the local aspect a bit and it doesn't offer me much incentive to purchase indirectly from The Social Page subdivision of weddingstar since I could actually get better deals directly from weddingstar through their promotions :(.

jF5M5JAf1m49Mk_x__W7TA,"Whatever you do, stay away from any free deal these people offer for you to sit through their timeshare presentation!!! On the paperwork it says the presentation lasts for 2-2 and a half hrs. Well when we showed up, our salesman told us we would be with him for the next 3 hrs. He was so nice at first, got along with my friend and I, laughed a lot and then when we asked how much the timeshare was, he wouldn't answer and kept changing the subject. He took us outside to show us the ""beautiful view"" which was dead desert. Not too beautiful to me. He walked us to the common room where people hangout and watch tv, everyone had to be 75 yrs and older, I am 30. It seemed more like a retirement home than a timeshare. I noticed it had been over two hrs and thanked him for his time but we weren't interested. He said we were not allowed to leave until the 3 hrs was up. I told him I signed a paper which said I only had to stay for two to two and a half hrs. He said if we left we would not receive the free things we were promised. So at this point we have literally been blackmailed and kidnapped since what I signed said I could leave after two hrs.  I figured we could tough it out since it would only be another 45 minutes. That 45 minutes felt longer than the first 2 hrs. These guys don't know the word no, they do not listen to you and they turn into assholes after they know you won't buy from them. I said no about 30 times and the manager walks up, tells us a guy is selling his timeshare and I can get it for the price of $12,000. Half price of what the timeshare was (which was a complete lie) I said no. He then lowered it to $4,000. Again, I said no. He then offered me the timeshare for free and all I had to do was pay the $1,000 taxes each year and put down $1400 today and my week stays would be the $209 a week. I swear if I had to hear them say "" and for ONLY $209 a week you can stay ANYWHERE in the world"" one more time, I was going to scream. They made my friend cry out of frustration of not allowing us to leave  at the 3 hr mark and they kept pressuring us and wouldn't sign the paper saying we finished the presentation. It was like they wanted to make us so mad I would just sign up so they would shut up. When you don't listen to a girl when she says no, hold her against her will and make her cry and say sexual remarks about her body the entire time it's a close feeling to being sexually abused.....not okay.....At 3 hrs and 20 minutes we were finally told we could leave.....finally free. We were sent to another room to tell a man how our presentation went. As my friend was still crying we told him how awful it was. He had to fill out a questionnaire on our answers and the question on the page said ""how was the presentation"" after we told him how awful they were to us I saw him write ""good"" on the answer line.....he straight up lied on their questionnaire! I then was sent to another man to get my 4 free nights at the Luxor and my $200 deposit back. He said it would take two days to be put back into my account. It took over a week. When we got on the bus, everyone had similar stories. I was the only one who was dumb enough to put a $200 deposit down.

I was not impressed.  1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people.  They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines.  The thing that really upset me was the terrible service.  I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer me any direction on how to order.  I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line.  2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos.  3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn't wait to get out of work.  I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it.
